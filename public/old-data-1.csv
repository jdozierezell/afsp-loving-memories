You were struggling but still managed to make those around you feel so happy. You were always the best to everyone even when you were feeling the worst. It‚Äôs only been a couple of years now, but it feels like yesterday that we were playing music together for the first and last time. I wish I would have known, because I wouldn‚Äôt have gone to bed so soon. All I have left is a poem and something you drank out of. I know you never meant to hurt me. I‚Äôm just glad to know you‚Äôre free now. I miss you. And I love you forever. You are always in my dreams and I‚Äôm so grateful for that.

This child radiated pure love and joy and even though they‚Äôre no longer with us, that is the legacy they left with us. Forever 13 is what her mom says, but it shouldn‚Äôt be that way. Her mom should have   hosted her 16th birthday this year, not another memorial. It‚Äôll be 3 years next month. The world is too cruel.

She pretty much announced she was my friend when we new coworkers. I'd never had anyone do that before. She didn't just say it she was always there for me when I was falling apart. She became one of my closest & best friends. I loved her. I was not blind to the fact that behind her rough exterior she not only had a heart of gold & would help anyone in need, her life was filled with such pain since childhood.  All I could do was be her friend & pray every day that I knew her for the Lord to stop her pain. She was not the type to let anyone help her. I prayed so much that when I received the call the day after my birthday in 2006 that she had taken her own life I said Lord that's not how I meant for her to find peace from her pain. I felt some guilt with that. That single phone call was the most pain I've ever felt.i felt like someone punched me in the gut while someone ripped out my heart at the very same time. There were so many external factors going on in her life at the time of her death. It was a storm.

We only know our story. We can only speak to our relationship with her. And the beautiful thing is that we all have our own story. She touched our lives, your life maybe, in a different way. Some knew her extremely well. Some knew her by name. Some knew her writing and teachings. But all of us remember her light. Her beautiful children. She was a mama that loved her babies. She was a woman with something to say. She was more than many people knew. In all reality, I feel I have a better sense of her now. I talk to her, I ask her for guidance with Bo, with Hutson. When she was with us, she was dealing with an illness. The very same mental illness that her brother deals with daily. And I know more about that now, than when I came into the family. I didn‚Äôt get to know the woman who she was when Bo was younger. The one he tells me not very many people ever got to see. 
I have lived alongside his struggle and It helps me understand her struggle. May is mental health awareness month. We have to talk about this, especially now. Because to erase any part of her story would be a disservice. She is much more than the actions of that day.  She was human, and a good one at that. You are much more than the feelings you are feeling. You are human, and that‚Äôs worth all of us giving a damn. We are all stronger together."

He was born at home to James and Katrina Fuller, who welcomed and dedicated him to God with love. Throughout his life, he was involved in church, school, theater, soccer, coach pitch, karate, flag and tackle football, and swim and dive. He wanted to be a super hero, police officer, firefighter, anesthesiologist, or professional football player when he grew up. Landon was extraordinarily curious and intelligent and had many interests, including superheroes, anime, drawing, video games, building blocks, collecting cards, reading, singing, and dancing. It was rare to see him without his signature beaming smile, and the gleam in his eyes spoke to his charm, humor, and mischievous spirit. His great loves in life were his family, friends, and dog. While under stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Landon missed school and his friends. Even in the midst of a quarantine, his social butterfly wings could not be clipped, and he was able to fly. His love for people and life was so powerful, he could not be kept down. Landon will be deeply missed and forever remembered by his family and community.

I Love you with every single ounce of Love that I have inside me. I am so very lucky to have had you as my Mother. 

I lost my Mom to suicide September 22nd 2019. In my Moms happiest of times she was so silly and loved to joke. She was a lover of a variety of music and enjoyed going to concerts. One of my favorite memories is laughing uncontrollable while on a doctors visit. We couldn't make eye contact when the doctor would come into the room or we'd just laugh for no reason at all. We didn't always get along while I was growing up. But as an adult she became my best friend. 
I only wished we had more time together. "

Liz was also the most brilliant person I've ever met! She was pursuing a double Master's in Internet of Things, and Embedded Systems when she had taken her own life. Her school administration had mentioned how exceptionally talented, brilliant, and hardworking Liz is. The loss of Liz was pain for many of us. All of us who had sent her off to Sweden to pursue the double Master's were reeling with the loss and shock. She was such an asset to the world!

I owe her so much because she had encouraged and convinced me to become an Algebra and Trigonometry tutor in college. She also gave me unwavering support as I struggled through computer science. She helped me understand concepts that I just couldn't wrap my head around. She was always there whenever I needed someone to listen. She was my best friend. I miss her. "

He would put a sheet over a TV tray to make a fancy restraint style experience in our living room. If we were down he would try to play music he thought would lift us up or crack jokes to try and get a smile. He tired to make up for hurt feelings and tried to see the good in people he cared for. He liked steampunk and venom but he loved carnage and various other villains yet he was a sweet boy, who cared and felt more deeply than most knew. We will all remember him making faces to make us laugh, doing little things to bring us comfort or happiness and being a unique and caring boy.

I regret that I didn't get to spend more time with him. I live in Texas, while the rest of the family lives in Florida. However, we would usually get my parents out to visit us around the Fourth of July for my Mom's birthday. I remember this particular one in Fort Worth. We went to the botanical gardens to listen to the Forth Worth Symphony and watch the fireworks. It was a beautiful day spent just sitting out in the sun talking with my parents. Dad and Mom were so happy and my kids and husband were with us too. I'm grateful for these memories.

He always had the best jokes and shared the best advice. When he wasn't spending time with his family or friends, he loved to do cross fit so he could burn off all the calories from the BBQ he'd make in the weekends. He cared deeply for his family and loved ones, especially his small dog, Peter boy. Not a day goes by that we dont think of him. Every triumph, every happy moment, every celebration. His memory will continue as long as we remember the good times.

I am very proud to have been able to absorb his shining light for as long as I could, and I am a much better person because of it. He loved the outdoors, found art, and cooking, among many other things. Seth, you are very loved and missed.

In his 25 years of life Peyton lived his life boldly.  He had a passion for sports, especially lacrosse.  Making  others laugh was easily done; a comedian in the making.  One of my favorite memories was when he about 13 and we were at a soccer tournament.  Between games we ran to check a thrift store where his older brother picked up a set of handcuffs to place on Peyton as we are checking out. Peyton plays along and puts his hands behind his back ... we ended up at the local police station with three different officer attempts to get these off! I love you PFH !!"

Amir and I were best friends, I know it sounds so cliche but it's true, we understood each other like nobody else could. On 12/24/16 I gave birth to our son Graison, Graison passed away a few hours later, it broke our hearts but we had each other. Amir couldn't stand to see the hurt in my eyes and to feel as if he couldn't fix it, and so on 12/1/17, Amir ended his life. I wish he knew that he was the only reason I held on after Graison died. Now he's gone too.

My mom was smart, kind, loving, down to earth and contemporary. When I was growing up, she was the mom that my friends wanted to confide in. She raised me with great values and, while she never got to meet her granddaughter, she made me the best mom I can be and forever watches over us.

The most selfless friend and family member.  Loved family gatherings, being spontaneous with his friends, enjoyed going to gym.  He had a sweet grin and gentleness about him.  He loved his family and never wanted to hurt them.  Many friends have shared stories of Nick jumping to help anyone in need, putting his needs aside to ensure others were happy.  I miss so much about him.  I loved when he would simply say ‚Äúhi, Aunt Johnna‚Äù.  Please hear me when I talk to you, Big Nick.  My heart is broken.

He was only 45 years old born February 6, 1973 and died July 17, 2018.  He was a photographer, a great writer and poet, an artist at best.  He was overwhelmed with depression despite his fun loving happy face. Brian‚Äôs absence in this world is a great loss. He left behind his sister Jaime and his two nephews Elijah and Riley. Brian was our only son and we will be forever heartbroken and empty with him gone. God Bless our son.

When I did the Out of the Darkness walk a couple months ago, I thought I was doing it for myself, but I guess a Higher Power knew something I didn't know that day in Belmar. Times were certainly not always wonderful but I thought we had an understanding. Thank you for teaching me to fish, taking me on all the roller coasters when I got big enough, and sharing your pork roll, egg, and cheese sandwiches with me when I was growing up. Our relationship was different, we understood each other, or at least I thought we did. I love you!

He took time to play with us when we were small and was a very good provider.  He created board and card games that we would play as a family.  I was only 12 when he passed in 197.  I remember one night I tried to stay up and watch a movie with him and I fell asleep.  I woke up and he was tucking me into bed and he told me I was special.  I love him so much and spend hours revisiting the short time we had together.  I will remember him for his love for me as his youngest daughter. I miss you, Dad!  Love You Forever!

He would make fun of me because bugs scared me and I would run across campus if I got chased by one which made him laugh. I knew it was his way of saying goodbye to me. His final joke.

He was kind, funny, and smart, and he had a huge heart. He worked in the dining room at an assisted living facility, and the residents there spoke of how polite and respectful he was, and how he always had a smile for them. On one occasion, one of the ladies was feeling sad, and he made it a point to go over to her, asking her if she had any single grand daughters she could introduce him to. That‚Äôs the kind of young man he was, always thinking of others.

Through art, she could find solace in not always knowing the right things to say, or the next moves to take. She was a quirky, fun, silly, and curious woman. It was this genuine aspect of her that allowed her to seamlessly become friends with anyone. Unfortunately, our sweet Lindsey has always battled with severe depression, and after losing two very dear friends of her own to suicide, on November 30th, 2019, Lindsey took her life.

She was an amazing woman and even in the very short amount of time that I knew her, she made a huge impact on my life.  She was a very creative person, she had a true passion for cooking, baking and sewing.  She loved it when I helped her in the kitchen, picking me up and putting me right on the kitchen counter to help stir the bowl. I hope to educate people on getting help if they are depressed...

He has such a beautiful soul and you can feel the genuine love of my son by first meeting him.  Words cannot describe how many pieces within me are beyond repair.  When people would ask me what it's like to be a parent, my response would always be ""He is my heart outside of my body!""  What I would not give to hug him, kiss him, hold his hand, hear his laugh.... the list goes on.  Chandler is my only child and I will continue to walk with my head held high as well as keep fighting the fight for him!!!  He is my hero"

It was super boring so we left early and went to our town hangout spot to see what some of our other friends wanted to do. We ended up going to the towns designated racing spot called ""flat mile"" and us and all of our friends were just hanging out watching the nightly races. It was such a simple, ordinary night but it will always be one of my favorite memories of us. Rest easy Jayson. I love you 224. Fly high."

We shared our lives
And showed we care

Always a call away
Wiped my tears 
When I was sick or sad
We were there for each other

Sunday dinners a delicious affair
Now you will have to join from up there
You tell me there is no need to despair
Because you are forever in my heart.

Stevie was loving, caring, honest, and funny. He never met a stranger. He loved traveling around the United States. He was a lost soul that helped so many people. He'd grow a garden every year and go around town giving the vegetables to people he knew liked them because he didn't like vegetables. He cared greatly for others. Yet, it was hard for him to accept love from anyone. And I'm not sure why. He was scared that no one loved him. He just felt so alone even though he had many friends. He just didn't realize his kindness meant so much to many everyone."

This time of year I always laugh and smile a lot because 
Easter was always such a fun time in our house growing 
Up as kids, next to Christmas, it didn‚Äôt get any better! 
We would always wake up to a fully decorated house with Easter baskets full of candy and spend the day dying eggs with grandma, going to church in a new really nice outfit and then off to Turtle Back Zoo and Dairy Queen. The we would headline have dinner and eat Easter candy until we passed out! Good times I will always remember ...."

Being married to Jason and having a chance to spend the rest of his life with him was the greatest privilege of my life.  Love you tremendously, Jason!

Together again is what I pray,

That is the Heavenly way,
'Til then on Earth I patiently wait,
Waiting for Reunion Day.

With Love,
Your Son, Ron"

She was only 24 years old. She was my elder daughter, my middle child. She was beautiful. She was talented. She was intelligent and educated. Sadly, she lived under the dark shadow of a severe mood disorder. In her short life she inspired many people. A year after she fell victim to drug addiction, she ended her life. We are grateful for the time we shared with her.

There are so many special days with my son, we were very close.   Mike was one of the funniest people we knew and had a huge amount of friends and was larger then life. His last name was Kissell so everyone called him Kiss. Ex Army Chaplain Assistant.  Not enough space to write everything I want to say. I started a page in his memory on FB for people with suicidal thoughts and blog about that and depression, it's call Suicide: Unofficial. 

Thank you for letting me share in this beautiful idea.

Behind the scenes he was a self-employed hard working man. He had an over-the-top personality, he made everyone his friend but at the same time was shy. Racing was his heart. Didn't matter if it was demo derby car or a street stock. His eyes lit up and his heart was full when he was racing. As a result of losing my dad  my depression and anxiety are sometimes borderline too much to handle. I have become very involved in whatever I can to help raise Suicide Awareness and help others.

He would always come to save the day if I was in need, and I never imagined he wouldn't be there. We had already lost the rest of our family and through our grief we became besties. And I will always remember how tender hearted he truly was. The hardest working man I've ever known. So incredibly silly. And a avid outdoorsman, and always looking for love and acceptance. RIP"

We had been friends for a while, but had just started dating a few months prior to her death.  She brought joy and light to my life.  Friends would say they had never seen me so happy before.  We had only dated about 7 months, so honestly every moment I spent with her was special.  Everything from our first date that I didn‚Äôt know was a date until almost a week later to our one and only Christmas together.

I would always joke that he could find a two thousand dollar suit at Salvation Army, buy it for $30. then have it cleaned and tailored and he would look like a million dollars. I never thought about this before but maybe he needed to put forth a beautiful exterior because he did not feel so good on the inside. He was a truly beautiful, kind man who brought so much love and so many talents to the table. I miss him every day, every hour, every minute and every second.

He was always looking out for everyone especially if he saw someone sad he would make sure they would be smiling by the time he left them. Always a  phone call away.  His smile would light up the room and his positive advice he would give was so sincere always encouraging to see the good in everyone. His love for music showed always wearing his headphones and singing all the lyrics to every song will be missed. He is my hero. The best son a mother can ask for. RIP AJ

Sometimes to the point where we couldn't stop until our bellies and our cheeks hurt.  Oh how I miss that.  Bill served in the U.S. Army and did a tour in Viet Nam.

Thousands of questions still remain unanswered. I can only hope and pray he knew how much he meant to me and how much I loved him.  Gone but not forgotten....

He fought many brave battles with all the demons associated with the disease when he decided he could not take the pain and darkness any longer. When I lost his father 2 years ago I thought my heart coul not break any moe, but found it could when Jason went . My only solace is that they are both at peace and out of pain. Jason was a kind gentle man he gave so much to everyone as I heard over and over from testimonies of his diverse group of friends, I just wish he would have saved more of that love for himself.

Always happy, always helpful, a great friend, a loving brother, uncle, cousin, grandson, nephew, and my amazing son. You put 100% in all that you did. You loved knowledge and sough it out where ever you could. You are bigger than life you always strove for more, to do more, to be more. Your humor was uncontrollable.  Your ambition was admirable. Your legacy is in breakable.
 We love you. We miss you. No one will ever fill your spot in our family and in our hearts."

She would always reach out to others to make them smile when they were feeling down and was many peoples ‚Äòfirst friend‚Äô because of this. She had a way to put a smile on anyone‚Äôs face . She will be missed so very much by her friends and family but most of all by me and her brother and sister.

Hunter was a rising senior at North Brunswick High School and a member of their Army JROTC program. On the outside Hunter was the brightest star, absolutely shining! Funny, outgoing, polite and generous. Always putting others before himself. On the inside he was battling demons that we worked to help him overcome but in the end, he succumbed to his demons.

Mine and my brother's.He left us on December 4,2017. He was grandfather to 9 and great-grandfather to 2. Our daddy was an amazing, loving man. All who knew him, knew him as a giving soul. He had his demons just as we all do. He was very sick.  And couldn't work anymore. All my life he got us and went to work. Health issues prevented that in the last year of his life. He loved rockn roll and alabama football. He passed his love for both on to me. Not a day goes by that i dont think of him. But i know i will see him and hold his hand again one day. Until then rock on daddy.

He used to talk to me all the time about what he wanted to do, where he wanted to go. He was very much a family guy. He loved his siblings and spending time with them, doing what boys like to do. He is greatly missed and forever loved.

He never had a bad word about anyone or thing.  He was a diary writer and I am finally just began reading his works.

An extraordinary part of our family chose to leave us on Sunday, October 15, 2017. He was such a bright star in all of our lives.  Jason had such a gift of touching and connecting with everyone he met. Memories of his giant hugs and random texts are dear to us. He had a true compassion for others and their trials. Everything Jason did was ""full tilt.""  We will miss him for the rest of our lives...until we meet again! Love you forever Jason!!!!"

He was always so full of life. His laughter was definitely one of a kind and was super contagious. He was always full of jokes and could make anyone smile, even on their bad days. His kindness was also another remarkable quality of his. Stephen has definitely left a huge gap in our lives and hearts. He is deeply missed by his family and especially his friends. I will never forget you bother, you will always hold a piece of me.

The first things out of his mouth were ‚Äúif you hurt my sister.‚Äù He had the biggest heart, and anyone you talk to will tell you that Brandon would do anything for anyone, even give you the shirt off his back.

She would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it, yet she also had an attitude when needed. She was just so awesome.

She was one of the funniest people, she was was a police officer, she was little, but she could handle her own, for sure. I remember the last day we worked together, it was a Tuesday, we had worked a 12 hour shift 8am-8pm. She had been in a funk, due to ending a relationship, but that Tuesday she was in a great mood and seemed to be back to her self. I‚Äôll never forget the phone call I received Thursday morning.

Our best memories of him are how he made us laugh or how his mind worked to build silly things. He loved tearing things apart and promising he could make them work better. His best Passion was playing his electric guitar. He could play the most difficult song and have fun with it too. His foremost passion was making sure his niece's were happy on holidays. He went above and beyond always for them. He loved his older brother and younger sister no matter what stage of life they were in. Life without him will never be the same.

He is the sweetest young man and always went out of his way to make everyone smile, comfortable and happy in life. He saved a young girl in 7th grade from committing suicide only for it to take his life a couple years later. He was graduating from high school this June and had planned to join the Marines or enter into college to get an engineering degree. Everyday is a struggle without him here, with the strength God gives me daily I put one foot in front of the other and try to cope with the loss of my precious son.

Marie was just 21 years old and described by others as spunky, friendly, generous and hard working. Her ability to have fun no matter what she was doing drew people to her. But she could also be anxious, stressed and overwhelmed. Even though we loved Marie fiercely, and she was surrounded by a circle of friends at college, she felt unable to cope. One Saturday in November, she took her own life.

She left behind many who are heartbroken."

She loved nature and often wrote about it. She had a magical smile that truly lit up the room and an infectious laugh. She was warm and fun, she had an affinity for kids and often said she was still one herself. She struggled a lot though and often had a hard time seeing the light. She held several degrees and was well known for her intelligence. She is dearly missed by her 2 daughters, grandson and friends. The world got that much dimmer at her passing. We love you Mama, always and forever.

there is a beautiful thing inside you that is thousands of years old .
Too old to be captured in poems . Too old to be loved by everyone .
But loved so very deeply by a chosen few ~ Nikita Gill .And we were those chosen ones . 
You had the most beautiful eyes , the kind you did get lost in . The door to your soul. 
Old souls like you feel more intense ,
suffer more deeply and love more dearly .
Joshua , you left your blueprint on our minds ,
your handprint on our hearts and your imprint on our souls .
Love always ~ your family"

He was such a good kid with a kind heart and a loving smile. Tre loved animals and wanted to bring all of the strays home. He especially loved his boxer Panzer and his cat Skittles. Tre was just like a big teddy bear. He loved mexican food and chocolate. Tre never said an unkind word and had a big heart for family and friends. He enjoyed playing video games.

He became a world-class Capoeirista, traveling to many countries and performing.
He liked to make everybody laugh and for that purpose he brought me lots of mr. Bean movies and silly cat videos because he knew those would make me laugh !
He loved skiing and snowboarding and we spent all our free time in the winters up in the mountains. Throughout his childhood, we spent our summers camping and river rafting and backpacking and hiking, pretty well all 2 months of each summer."

He hated how everyone wanted to help take care of him, but would be the first person to defend you. He was never afraid to tell you what he really thought, yet never crossed boundaries and intentionally hurt anyone. He truly cared about his people, more than he did himself. I will forever carry his loss and not one day will go by where I dont miss him with every part of me. Rip baby brother.

I lost him Sept. 11, 2005. I was 23 years old at the time. He suffered from depression for many years. Depression runs very deep on his side of the family.I wasn‚Äôt always aware of his struggles though. Growing up I remember he was fun and ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. He was always joking around. He loved to be in his garage working on classic cars. I can remember many nights we spent out there late at night sanding down cars and talking. But no matter what kind of rare car he had at the time, my bros and I were always his pride and joy. Of course I was daddy‚Äôs girl. I miss him... a lot.

The way she smiles and laughs, the way she expresses herself and shares her love is so authentic. Nothing could really match the friendship I had with her with anyone else. I knew she truly cared about me during our journey in the IOP program (group therapy). Something about her made me feel like I was understood without explaining myself.  I never had anyone connect and think the same way I do in a deeper level. We were both fighting depression. She fought so hard, and I know she is still one of the strongest girls I've ever met.

He never met a stranger and helped others anyways he could.  He had a contiguous laugh and always made the best out of any situation.  He was a lover of music and trout fishing.  He served his country 7 years in the USMC then became a train engineer.  He loved God, his family and friends without reservation.  He was always forgiving, humble, and kind.  He made life an adventure, always seen the beauty in all things.  He is greatly missed by myself (his wife), 2 daughters,  2 step sons,  a grandson as well as the rest of his family.

My fondest memory of her was when we took a road trip to Graceland to commemorate my fiftieth birthday. She was the best companion and navigator, keeping us on the right roads as we zipped through many states and adventures. We laughed at the absurdity of a Stonehenge made of foam and saluted Man O'War's grave. We immortalized our journey by cutting a CD at Sun Records by singing Return to Sender. At the Serpent Mound, she saw a real snake, a sign of her powerful medicine, indeed. She was a healer, a friend, a sister. I miss her, but I remember her daily.

There's not a day that goes by that I don't miss him, and  I don't think that will ever change. He loved to fish, watch movies, and eat chinese food. Austin was a free spirit, with a heart of gold. I love you, beeb. I miss you.

His story was different from many others in that he didn't suffer from mental illness, or depression, there were no warning signs. He was a proud husband, a proud father, a proud papa and a proud Sargent. He was one you could count on for words of comfort and encouragement during the tough times.  He had genuine delight and excitement when life smiled on us. He could always be counted on for his sense of humor and his big, happy smiles and hearty laughs.

She decided to try out water skiing when she was 50! Tried her skills out on a moped in her 40s. Tried out spelunking in her 40s. She went snorkeling for the the first time in her 40s. And would pack a bag and driver herself hours to get to her destination by herself or with others.  It was only until after her diagnosis with schizophrenia and the medicinal roller coaster that sucked away her zest for life. I choose to remember her for her love to laugh and sense of adventure. 
Thank you, Mom for the sweet memories. I miss you."

As an artist she loved to paint, draw and take pictures of everything from tiny bugs, flowers and landscapes to people and events such as weddings. She was the photographer for her Grandfather's wedding. She,had a small business of drawing animals called Pencil Pet Portraits. She captured the animals personality perfectly. She was also a poet in which many poems were printed in poetry books and won many contests. My Morgan loved to make people laugh. She had an alter personality she called Ru. We love to mimic her & laugh.

Gia was an adult but her heart was of a child who loved wholeheartedly and believed in the fairy tale ending in life.  She was always there for anyone who needed her.  She loved all animals and if she could, she would have adopted each and everyone of them.

He would always make any holiday fun and took great pride in our country.   I learned so much about life from him.   He taught us to work hard and how to be there for others.   He has missed out on 4 grandchildren a great grandchild and his granddaughters marriages.   I keep his memory alive and I miss him so much

Sure, my father struggled with mental illness, but this picture depicts the man I knew.  He loved the sun and being tan, he exercised until his knees didn't allow for it, and he had a smile that could brighten up a room.  He had a laugh that was unlike any other laugh I've heard.  This is my father....

He was my best friend. He passed at only 13. It‚Äôll be 20 years in March. I think of him everyday and wonder who he would be today. I miss him every second. I love you, Keith."

She worked hard and was treated harshly.  She worked at Krogers for 32 years and never received more than $18.30 an hour.   She was a department manager.   She was gay and lived in the south: she was treated poorly for being gay.   I was raised with Moogy and knew how amazing, brilliant loving, patient and deserving she was of a good or even par life.   She was a gentle kind soul who just never got a break.   We caught fireflies, climbed trees and fished together.   She was my beloved buddy.  I will miss you for a life time my dear Aunty, Sister and devoted Friend. rip

He was outgoing and loved to make me wrestle just to go from one room to any other part of the house. We joked often about his hair loss and he would always reply quickly with a smart statement. Growing up, he was my idol. He showed me everything that made me who I am today including my interest in music, video games, and random little facts that seem useless.

On October 18, 2014 we lost Trey to suicide. This was a heartbreaking and tragic time for our family. Trey was a gifted athlete, avid outdoors man and great friend who was loved by everyone. Trey had the most contagious smile and loving personality. He was on the 2008 Indiana state all-star football team and received a football scholarship to Olivet Nazarene University. He is missed everyday."

Even with coaching when his girls where to old to coach he started vounteering coaching the younger kids in softball. He would always say he just wanted the girls get treated like the boys baseball teams. Not knowing much about the sport of softball in the beginning he decided to start off with just being the president of softball but as he got to know the sport he decided to step down and coach. But that wasn't the only thing he was great at he could out cook anybody. Everyone loved to eat Jrs cooking.

Still can't believe it's true. There was no sign, no warning, nothing to make me believe my beautiful baby boy would do this, two days before his birthday. He loved sports and video games and taking his little sister everywhere. He always had a smile on his face and would literally give you the shirt off his back to help you out. I wish there were answers but there are none.

It didn't matter if you were a stranger or a friend, she took an interest in you and your life and wanted to help you in anyway she could. She was so sweet, kindhearted, thoughtful and hilarious, and a beautiful person inside and out! I miss her deeply and wish she was still here.

Never good enough in his own eyes, yet completely perfect in God's. 
These photos were from a Sunday funday where we left straight from church for a cornmaze. but we got a little lost and the day was very hot. when rejoiced in laughter when we reached the ending, until in panic i realized Isaiah was not with us.minutes later he walked through the corn sweating and laughing.  the last 9 months has felt like we are back in a cornmaze, lost without him."

After the cruise, we stayed in touch and on January 2010, he proposed...and on October 15, 2010 we were married.

He was our strongest support system, our provider, our comforter, our shoulder to cry on, our teacher, our reason for laughter, but most importantly, he was our Dad. Mental illness is real. If someone is reaching out for help, do not turn away. Talk to them, comfort them. They only want your love. The more we talk about bringing awareness to suicide, the closer we get to preventing suicide. See something, say something. Love and respect one another.

One of his proudest moments was when an opponent was coming up fast to kick a goal and he dove down to capture the ball. The opponent kicked him full force in the face, breaking his nose and causing Joey to be disoriented. But he didn't let go of the ball and the opponent did not score a goal. He was amazing in his drive and dedication for the things he loved. Miss you always, baby. You are forever my Joey Bean.

Always had a smile on her face, she lit up a room with her personality and love for everyone, especially her family. She was extremely athletic and excelled at sports, her favorite was gymnastics. Her feet were in the air more than on the ground as she would flip instead of walking. One of my favorite memories is of her as a young child wanting to stop to give a homeless man her last dollar so he could eat.  She is missed by her parents, her younger brother and sister, and friends.

There are people here who love you and support you. The event has become an annual event on Appalachian State University's campus with a photo from it being shown in the NYT Education Life Section.

Most of the time you could find him on or near the water. When he wasn't catching up all of the fish, he fixed cars in the shop he owned, Elite Auto Werks. He was a man of adventure, fun, and amazing memories. Bob always had a camping trip or ski trip in the works and his 3 kids (myself included here) were very lucky to take part of the exciting experiences he provided! He lost his joy for living following a head injury. He thought he was a different person and that no one wanted him anymore. There haven't been many adventures since he left us. RIP Dad. Love u

He most enjoyed times spent loving and caring for his family. He had a heart for others. I remember one time in the winter he gathered up blankets and went around town to give them to the homeless. The last few months of his life he was devoted to attending Praise Chapel where he had found Jesus in his heart. He went home to be with his father God on August 12, 2012.

What he wanted most was to be loved by his friends and ensure no one ever felt left out even though he often felt left out himself. Despite his brilliant mind,  he was so young he could have never fully understood the consequences of his choice the day we lost him. He left behind 3 little brothers and we all miss him so much every single day.

So growing up it was just him and I. we did everything together, from karate, to swimming lessons and just tagging along with each other. David was very talented, he loved to play soccer. His dream was to be professional and I believed he would be. He was charming, witty and funny. He likes to come off as a tough guy, but anyone who knew him knew he was soft at heart. Losing him was devastating. absolutely agonizing. It still is, but I was so very lucky to have him for the time that I did. I will hold our memories near to my heart.

She was brilliant, talented, humorous and had multiple friends that loved her dearly.  Her life took a change for the worst, when she suddenly lost her dad at her young age of 11.   The next 5 years would become a constant and roller coaster filled with good days and then the evil, dark days that finally won.  She longed to be with her dad again, and that is the only thing that gives me comfort (knowing that).   I miss her and my brother so very much, but know I will see them one day again.

He was more than a suicide victim. He was a hard worker, a great dad, a husband, son, brother, friend. He was adventurous. He loved a challenge. He made decisions on the fly & they almost always turned out exactly how he intended. He was loyal. He was one of a kind, truly ONE of a kind. I'm blessed to have known him. Blessed to have loved him. Blessed to be raising his legacy.

Sometimes ""Tomorrow"" never comes and then what? You're left with the what ifs and I should haves. Depression is real. I miss my father every day and have little conversations with him in my head. The sound of his voice is still strong in my ears and the way he said my name will be something I'll never forget. Just one more hug.. just one more smile.. Life still needs to be lived and even in my sadness, I'll smile for him. I'll live for my father the life he was unable to. Until we meet again.."

He loved being a father and grandfather. I miss his big smile & tight hugs. I miss the security I had in knowing his unconditional love was always there, waiting for me. In the end, I believe he was too sensitive for this world. Empathetic to the point that the burden of feeling SO much was too much. He didn't choose to leave me, his pain simply was too much.... it took his life. I miss you, dad.

He'd take the shirt off his back to help out others in need.  He was a lot of fun to be around. Mike was a jokester, lover of animals and a friend to many. 
His passion in life was helping others.  He loved skateboarding, glass blowing, bonfires, disc golf, hanging with his friends, but mostly ,his family. 
His bright smile, crazy noises he would make and his loving hugs are the things we miss the most.  Rest  peacefully son."

Confident, side-splittingly hilarious, Mr. Fix It, hard working, protective, caring, nature-loving, salt of the earth, genuine. These are the words I associate with my dad. As I look back I remember hikes in the woods, drives in his old car, and all the advice he's given me over the years, making me feel fiercely loved in every moment. JK Rowling wrote, ""Love ... leaves it's own mark. To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever."" I feel that every day in his absence. No doubt I'll love him forever."

We lost him in 2013.  We think that some of the reason for this was because he lost his big brother Mike in 2010 to suicide and was still struggling with it.  It's a lifetime struggle.  We never thought we would lose another child to suicide.  He is missed everyday and his daughter still asks about him and struggles with his loss.

Your presence was indescribable, when we met I knew you were going to have such a big part in my life. Little did I know I'd fall for you, and start a family with you. No one could ever prepare me for the night you couldn't hang in there anymore. 6 years later your memory still burns bright and I refuse to let it go out. Loosing you has been the hugest silver linings in my life, it's taught me so much about myself and life. I wish it could have been learned with you still here but for reasons unknown this is the reality. 2/11/11</3

Michael came into the world with red lights and sirens and lived his life, always speeding down the path to his goals.
He became a talented design engineer. His company was so impressed with his discipline that they promoted him without the required degree. Before his death he was fortunate to be able to travel the world in his work. Michael was an avid hunter, an accomplished guitarist and somewhat of a cowboy. He is loved and missed!"

It is a tornado that uplifts you, throws you around and you are trying to find out the reasons why they ended their life. Guilt sets in for a while as well as total darkness. Somehow slowly I have found my way out of the darkness by volunteering and sharing my story as much as I can.

I remember at one point seeing him run off to my house from the neighborhood so I ran and caught up to him and asked him what he was doing- no answer. When we got in the house he ran straight to my kitchen and immediately started eating a banana. After he had taken a few bites he looked at me and said ""I just ate something SO spicy and the banana helps"". I don't know what it is about that moment, but whenever I think of it, it makes me smile. Miss you always, UD."

He was smart, funny, caring and dedicated. His goal in life was to be a neurologist so that he could cure Alzheimer's. He is missed beyond measure, but his legacy lives on as we participate in charity events to honor him.

My dad, Richard Keith was such a character.  The same for my brother.  They could make you laugh until your stomach hurt & you could hear their laugh a mile away. Almost a chuckle. That is the one thing I miss the most about them. When I'm having a bad day, I try to think of what they would say to make me not worry. This world is very quiet without them. They both had a heart of gold & would do anything for anyone. Because of this, I honor them by helping others. If I can help save a life, I know they will be so proud.

We spent seven years together.  We shared times at the local jetties together and many times on or near the water, where he was the happiest. Many nights we would laugh, watch music videos, sing to each other and dance in the living room. He was passionate about cooking, putting as much into the presentation of a dish as the flavor.  I will forever miss his hand in mine in the car or while sitting on the couch. I will miss the words which he spoke that made may heart full. He took a piece of me when he left. You will always be loved, Matt.

He loved gaming especially with his friends.   One of his favorite Christian bands was coming to a city about 2 hours from us and he so wanted to go.  It was a school night and I was not crazy about the idea but I did promise him if they came near to us I would take him.  He couldn't get any of his friends parents to consent to them going being that it was a school night so it was just him and me.  I have to say that was one of the best times he and I had together.  I loved watching him have so much fun.   This is one of my most cherished memories.

He loved motocross and sharing his love for the sport with my brother and I. To this day, the smell of dirt, oil, and gas at the track reminds me he is never too far away.

I always called him my little man and even in front of his friends he always called me mama. Zach loved nature, fishing, his family and friends, school and most of all life. One of his biggest wishes was just for peace. I miss his big bear hugs most of all. Zach joined us on 4/28/97 and became an angel on 12/2/11 at just 14 years old. There are many ways I keep his memory alive: saying his name, cherished memories, buying a cake for his birthday. My favorite is having tea with the tea kettle he got for me. Zach knew mine broke and that I loved all things vintage. So he found an old fashioned tea kettle for me. I'll always treasure that just as I'll always treasure my little man.

Her best friend found her and got her breathing again but it was too late she was already brain dead.  While she was in the ICU we were able to meet so many people who told us all the wonderful things she did for them and the problems she helped them through.  That's the way she was and so we carry on her legacy to help other families to talk to their children and loved ones and get them the help they need so they can see beyond their sadness.

He was so brave with his battle but often struggled in silence as he was more focused on making everyone around him happy. He always had a joke or an ornery prank. I wish I could hear his obnoxious laughter after one of those pranks just one more time. I miss him every day and I will never let his death be in vein. I will make a daily effort to bring mental illness out of the darkness and ending the stigma for those who suffer.

He self medicated, was drug addicted, and left behind a fury of emotion and drama that has torn his family apart.

Unfortunately, he also was riddled with demons that he vigorously fought and thought he conquered many a time. But that's the thing about demons, they always come back. According to numerous statistics one active duty soldier and 22 veterans take their own lives every day. While I'm heartbroken that my beloved brother falls into this statistic, and I have an enormous hole in my heart that will never heal, I find some solace in the words of a man my brother loved, Dr. Seuss: ""I'm glad we had the times together just to laugh and sing a song, seems like we just got started and then before you know it, the times we had together were gone."" I love you Scott, and miss you beyond words!!!"

Logan was always being goofy, constantly trying to make others around him smile. He would've done absolutely anything to make someone else laugh. Logan was surrounded by countless friends and family members who loved him and would have dropped everything to help him out.

I'm involved with AFSP to honor little Logan, to help out others who are struggling through similar situations, and to ensure that others never have to go through the pain that his friends and I experienced when we lost Logan. So many people go through life suffering inside while keeping on a happy face for the world and trying to make others laugh. Mental illness such as depression should not be something we need to hide from others, but rather something that we can talk about openly in an accepting environment. By raising money for suicide prevention and talking about mental health, we're reducing the stigma behind it and encouraging others to speak up about how they're feeling and to listen to others in an accepting manner when they open up about issues of mental health and suicide.

For me, Logan was my best friend and my worst friend. He taught me the full spectrum of human emotion. He gave me the best days of my life that were filled with complete and utter happiness, times when I had my heart packed with nothing but love. He gave me the worst days of my life, times when I experienced heartbreak, pain, anger, jealousy, and resentment. He taught me how to love unconditionally and care for someone more than myself. He taught me how to forgive. He taught me how to be forgiven. When he died he taugh me how to lose.
Now he's teaching me to live.

""In life we are all just searching for peace/happiness/love and for some there are more obstacles and roadblocks to overcome but through all the rain and the pain ya gotta keep your head up""

Marcus was so well-known and popular in our small town as well as the whole state of MS being playing drums professionally his whole life. No matter what time or day, he was there for me and a blessing we only lived three houses between each other. Marcus also looked out for me as his little sister not letting anyone hurt me and/or taking advantage of me since I was hearing-impaired and tend to let people walk all over me. It's been two years since his death, and I'm still grieving needing to talk with him daily and hangout. Some days I smiled because I can feel him beside me and and guiding me to keep our ministries going as well as looking back on so many memories of him. Marcus will never be forgotten."

Bradley, Jr. cuddling the little kitten I called Satan because it always attacked me.  He was like the cat-whisperer with her.  My son was diagnosed as ""terminal"" as an 18 month old with Neuroblastoma Stage IV, but miraculously he survived!  He lived a full and healthy life, as if he was trying to fill in every moment.  Then at 28 yrs old he was diagnosed with Cushings Disease and had his pituitary removed, which was unsuccessful.  Test after painful test, and experimental drug after experimental drug, and it still was not under control.  The disease causes Diabetes, and as a result of that he had one toe at a time amputated until half his foot was gone on one foot and only a few toes remained on the other.  But he still filled his life with every bit of living he could, while he could.  He filled his life helping others in any way he could. He tried to hang on and beat the depression he fell into, but the mental pain of living became as bad as the physical pain he was feeling, and in a moment, like water slipping through my fingers, he was gone. I only wish he'd known how loved he truly was.  His memory will live on in those whose lives he touched.  And he will live forever in my heart.   John Bradley Jr, 5.9.77 - 9.15.15   Rest well with the angels, sweet child of mine."

The definition of Family - Family is defined as a specific group of people (even if that group isn't related by blood), Definition of a Friend- The definition of friend is someone who is by your side and never leaves your side (even though they don't agree with your crazy decisions), Definition of Brother-one related to another by common ties or interest.

For the last 21 years, Johnnie  defined all of these for me and many others in his life. He was my family even though we weren't related by blood and was my brother . Johnnie was the person you called no matter what time of day it was and would always have something to say to make your day better.  The laughter, honesty, and the light he brought to me and others  is still deeply missed."

We grew up with a very rocky childhood. Both of use going through mentally and physically draining things at the hard of our step father. Though this was a difficult time, it brought us so close. He was the only person I could really be myself and talk to. He knew everything about me. All my fears, however big or small... and all my wildest most redicilous dreams. He was so amazingly talented. He was a musician, poet, photographer, and an artist. There was nothing he couldn't do and I always wanted to be just like him.
He struggled with depression for the past few years. I still remember the night he told me that he sometimes felt like he didn't want to live anymore. I remember crying on his floor that night as he told me all about it. Then a year later the thoughts got worse. He started taking anti depressants and even put himself into an in-patient when he felt like he was going to do himself hard. I was so proud of him. I texted him and told him how much I loved him and wanted him to get better. He said he loved me back and he wanted to be better. That was in July of 2015. In August of 2016 my brother lost his battle with depression. I miss him every day. He meant everything to me. I wish he would've realized how much I still need him in my life."

She was my world my rock my left hip and I her right. She was my mommy, and my life would FOREVER change in that moment when my father picked me up from school, got in the car and I asked what was wrong and the moment he replied baby you know; I knew my mother was not ok. 24 hours later after my oldest brother was able to say his goodbyes she finally passed away and we buried her June 5th 2002. Not a day goes by i dont think of her Miss her and struggle with my own problems. I wonder all the time what life would be like if my mom were still here but this I know, she is always with me and that it's farewell for now not forever.

One of her favorite things to do was Halloween Haunt at Kings Island amusement park in Mason, Ohio. She would scream her head off but then would laugh at how silly it was.

Mental illness in the form of mood disorders surfaced in her teens, but she spent most of her life self-coping and never followed through with consistent treatment.   Her illness, interfered with her ability to sustain healthy relationships with others and most importantly with herself.  At the end, I know all she was seeking was to end her pain; a pain we couldn't fix no matter how hard we tried.  

She was smart as a whip and had one wicked sense of humor.  We grew up side, by side, step by step being only 13 months apart.  Life is so much less sweeter without her.  To this day I hope, she left this earth never doubting our love for her. We miss her immensely and love her dearly."

He loved lacrosse and was so much fun to watch play. He was a great friend who loved big, no one more so than his younger brother. He loved music and rarely did anything without listening to it. He brought so much joy to others and he is missed every single minute. He was the all American teenage boy who had everything going for him until suicide ended his story far too soon.

I just want him to be remembered as such not as how he died. Growing up without him has not been easy but I believe it has made me become a much more empathetic and understanding person.
  I miss him more than anything. He was my hero. I wish he could meet my children and my husband. I wish he could grow old with my mom. I know if he could have seen how much hurt his death has caused I don't think he would have done what he did.  No matter what you are never alone and things always get better ;  this too shall pass."

One of my happiest memories of him is his overwhelming generosity. When my son was 6 years old, which was in 2001, we took him by uncle Scott's house to trick or treat for Halloween. He loaded him up with candy and asked what his favorite candy was. I can't remember what it was at the time, but when we took him trick or treating to his house the next year, my uncle had an entire bag of that particular candy just for my son! It was so thoughtful and caring that a year later he didn't forget my son's favorite candy. That,min a nutshell, is who Michael Scott Motes was as a person. We lost him in November 2004. He is missed daily.

My baby sister was everything you expected from the baby of a family: a brat ;). She helped me through a very hard time-leaving an abusive marriage with 3 little ones. She had a bit of a rough patch herself. We lived together and had the time of our lives, raising my kids, supporting each other, really getting to know each other. I will always have those days and I could never thank her enough. As you can see from her 'arrest' photo, she was quite a character. Beautiful, funny, giving, sarcastic, generous, and (I'll take some of the credit) a fabulous cook. I miss you every day, my Samiri."

His lead guitar could be heard with many NY bands in the 90's. No way to know which musicians today were influenced by Ian as a friend or teacher. He was a loving and involved father who adored his children, and that feeling was mutual.  When we got married, our home was filled with kids, toys, pets and love. Our bond was intimate and filled with his light. Blessed with a huge heart, a gentle soul and a fun personality; he lit up the room.  Unfortunately, that soul was too tender for his life.  He fought bravely against his demons, but was given no time recharge. Finally, he was worn out, used up and backed into a corner. 
When that amazing light went out, the world turned grey.  I am strengthened to know he is at peace, and heartbroken without him.  I cannot color the blackness in my soul; there are no more Ian colors.  
My love, I have loved you with my whole being since we met.  I will keep loving you after my last breath. I am crushed and will miss you until that breath.   Your Angel."

On June 9, 2016 he got tired of fighting. Jon was succeeding at life, owned his own house, and had a good career. He was very loved and had a heart that would do anything for anyone. His smile and sense of humor drew people to him.  He and his younger sister were best friends and dos everything together. He promised her for years he would never hurt himself.  We knew he was depressed but never had any idea he was suicidal. The hole he has left in our family and life can never be filled.  I try to find comfort that he is finally at peace.

He encountered financial troubles in the fall of 2010 and his drinking became heavier.  I'll never forget the phone call I received from my mother the day it happened. They were married 38 years. My mother never had any idea he was depressed. 

He was a father to 3 children, a grandfather to 2 children, a husband, son and brother. If only he knew how much he'd be missed..."

He loved puns, and was often cracking us up with his quick wit. When I was little, he made up delightful bedtime stories for me, in which I was the hero, saving my various animal friends from their predicaments. He loved nature, and we took many camping trips together as a family. My dad had a deep sense of loyalty, a love of math, and an appreciation for spicy food. He adored my mother, with whom he raised four daughters. A talented baritone, he performed with a community light opera company. He also enjoyed classical music, especially Beethoven. His last gift to me was a CD of the opera Lucie de Lammermoor. Whenever I hear the beautiful song of a mockingbird, I think of him."

He was an intelligent, fun-loving young man with a wide circle of friends and a charismatic personality.  Nick had a kind heart and genuinely cared about the people in his life and in the world as a whole.  A USAF veteran, lifelong learner, and serious Green Lantern fan (he even had a Green Lantern tattoo!), Nick was passionate about Buddhism, supporting free trade products, the LGTB community, and racial equality.  He was an outgoing, free-spirit and enjoyed recommending books and music to enlighten his Mom!!!!  Our family history of mental illness allowed frequent and open conversation about treatment options and care for this often hidden disease.  However, I mistakenly believed this shielded my son from dying by suicide - a regret that I will carry forever.

Andrew's sweet soul complemented his intelligence into his adult life. He truly was somebody special. ?"

She loved to cook, bake,shop, and she loved Christmas so much, we would call her our Christmas elf :) She was only 4 ft 11 so it made it even funnier when we called her that. Holidays are not the same without her. Me and my family miss her cakes and goodies. But most of all her laughs and her smile. There was no doubt that she lit up the room everytime she walked in. She is missed tremendously however her life lives on thru her 2 sons, age 11 and 5. We will see her again soon. If only she knew how much we loved her, that alone could have saved her :(  Forever in our hearts Jen...

People loved him and fell for his charisma and his way with words. I fell in love with him for his passion and enthusiasm, his kindness and intelligence, his fierceness and his beautiful heart. We were married in 4 months and had our ups and downs like every married couple has. What we didn't know was that he had BPD. Despite everything, we decided to have a baby and had our amazing Isabella in April 2010. We seperated in January 2011 and were divorced in May 2011. I wanted to stay with him with everything in me, but he wasn't happy and so I let him go. We ended up being great friends, and successfully co-parented our beautiful daughter. May 2012 was hard, he was admitted as an inpatient and diagnosed with BPD. Things were wonderful until October 29, 2012 when he didn't show up to work. It was so unusual that once I found out, I drove over to his apartment to check in. My dread grew as I couldn't get ahold of him though his car was there. I finally called the police as the apartment employees were unhelpful. I'll never forget the moment that I saw him and realized that the love of my life was gone. All I remember is screaming and sobbing and having to make that awful phone call to let everyone else know. We will miss him forever, he didn't know how loved he was. The months after were a blur, and I still visit his resting place often. Isabella and I will always love him, as will so many others. He was one of the most incredible people to have ever been in my life, and a piece of me went with him. I'm so grateful to have our wonderful daughter. We will miss him always, and I will love him always. We miss you so very much Nickai!!! ?

I have a daughter & another son, 4 grandkids. We lost Travis 20yrs old on Nov 16 2013.  Travis was funny, loved to joke around.  His passion was HUNTING, FISHING & OUT DOORS in the woods.  Nature was what he loved, I always called him "" Dr Doolittle "" from that movie where animals would talk to Eddie Murphy. That was Travis, he could get close enough to any animal & could pick it up & never get hurt.  When he was 10 he lost his right arm in a lawnmower accident. He had to relearn to train his brain to use his left arm now. Later he developed depression. We tried meds & counseling. Last few yrs of his life was hard on him. He was driving but No One would hire him for a job, they said he was a liability because of not having both arms to do the jobs. Travis with that one arm could  do more than some men with 2 arms.  Then Nov 16 2013 we lost him to Suicide. I'm so so heartbroken & a different person now. I realize Travis did what he did because he didn't know how to deal with the pain etc .  We Miss Him sooo sooo much, there are not any words you can think of to change the pain you feel or words anyone else can say.  Today when I see a deer I think of Travis.  I look at the woods or walk thru the woods I feel Travis. I understand why he would go to the woods, it's a sense of peace, serene for me too now.  We Love & Miss You Travis,  Until We Meet Again My Son, Watch Over Us All!"

This has been a very difficult road for me to recover from.I feel when my brother left this world he took a piece of my heart with him that will never return! This was my second family situation to suicide as our father comitted it 10 years prior to my brother almost to the exact date. My brother was such an amazing brother,uncle,and father! He left a little sweet baby girl behind and her beautiful momma!My brother Mark was a super smart guy who loved life and left his presence wherever he was! My brother was very proud of who he was,and he loved his job as a power lineman!He was an amazing brother growing up,I always had to take care of him,because our mom was a single mom and always had to work! We had to fight to survive at a lot of points in our lives! My brother was an absolute amazing uncle to my son and daughter throughout the years!Mark lived Texas and met Brenda the love of his life who we love so much and they had a sweet baby girl Elizabeth! He was the best father he could be to her! I have so many memories of him and I it's hard to just pick one! I miss him so much! They say it gets easier and I find its getting harder! I am reaching out to many in hope for support! Please continue to pray for my family! Thank you for allowing us to share our Mark's Family's

She loved wrestling and was amazing at writing even having a poem published. Her kindness was felt when she walked into a room. All of the children in her life; niece, friends children and families were always with her. Playing with the kids and being young at heart put a twinkle In her eye that wasn't usually there. She's missed as much today as she was years ago and will never be forgotten. Living on through speaking of her, trying to help others, and my children are sooo much like her in so many ways. We love you always baby girl

While she had a hard life and so many struggles of her own she was the most giving, generous, kind, funny, and loving person. Anyone who knew her knew she had a heart made of gold and that she would gladly give her last dollar away because others came first to her. I can't pick one story to share because I was blessed with 27 years with her I'd have to say some of my fondest memories were from our sleepovers that never stopped; we'd pile up on the couch with blankets, popcorn and M&Ms, candy, and a movie or movies and fall asleep on the couch. Regardless of genre we always ended up laughing together.
Here's a list of some things she loved, enjoyed, and personal qualities- she loved her family more than anything, she was a nurse who many say was the best nurse they'd ever met because she cared so much about her patients, she loved anything that made her laugh, she couldn't stand watching someone or something be mistreated - so she would intervene, the holidays, Dwight Yokum, and The Walking Dead (specifically Daryl lol). She's loved and missed by everyone that knew her."

My mother, sister and I will always cherish and hold dear to the memories we all have together. One of my fondest memories is how much our father loved Christmas and how he went above and beyond when it came to Christmas lights on the house. Each year he would add on to the house and eventually into the yard and trees. We was determined to win First Place for best Christmas Lights in our neighborhood. If I rembember correctly we came in second place one year! Our last Christmas we had together as a family, I had found a special gift that was very fitting for him. My sister love the Christmas Story and we will play it all day long (marthaon on TBS). Our father was not very found of the movie (hard to believe bc he loved Christmas) but it was the narrating that got to him. So as I'm shopping for the holidays I stumble across the LEG LAMP! This was PERFECT for our dad! We knew that he would get a chuckle out of it.

someday my nephew will ask me 
to tell him about his daddy

I can't wait for the day 
there are so many wonderful things to say
 
I'm not sure where I will start  
Maybe by telling  him about  ur golden heart

Then  I will tell him about your smile and flair 
and your crazy blonde 
hair
I will tell him  how u were a friend to all 
It didn't matter 
if they were rich ,poor ,big ,or small

I will tell him how you use to play him the  guitar
always joking about him being a rockstar

 I will tell him you were one of the best men  I ever knew so strong,real and true  

I will tell him u gave him his big feet 
good for kicking goals and running in a track meet 

I will tell him how u where willing to stand up and fight 

for what u believed was right 

Iwill tell him his eyes are the same color of blue
 and how much he reminds me of you
I will tell him even though u are not here to watch him grow 
ur daddy loves u more than u know

He reached out for help in all different places and to all different people. No one could seem to help him and give him the help he needed. He decided suicide was the way to go. Leaving beyond 5 younger siblings, his 3 year old daughter, a soon to be nephew, and all his friends and other family. I pray each day no one will ever have to suffer the pain our family has the past 3 years. I pray that everyone can come together, share their stories, get all the help they can, and we can raise awareness to prevent suicide from happening.

He will always be remembered for his smile that earned him the nickname of Smiley. He was always quick to help others and took great pride as craftsman. He also was a body piercer and was one of the best trained in Korean cuisine in all of Spokane, Washington. Despite making himself at home in Spokane with his family his Montanan born roots shown through. He particularly was proud of his Native American heritage and loved attending powwows. His family meant everything to him. He will be so missed but our love for him transcends the Earthly miles to Heaven where he is our guardian angel. We love you Mikey!!!

I'll never know why he made that choice but I know I'll never be the same again. My dad loved music, fishing, hunting, Nascar, golf, and he loved his family.  I would visit my dad every summer and he would always have plans to travel and take me places I've never been and also take me to places that we've enjoyed before.  We would spend hours jamming out to music and reminiscing about my younger years.  I'll treasure all those moments we shared together.  I love you and miss you dad! Love, your beauty queen

He loved to hunt, fish, and explore. He played golf and enjoyed just being outside in nature. He adored his two daughters, Madison and Peyton, and loved his wife Kelli. Steven loved his family dearly. He helped our parents around their house and could sit and rock in a rocking chair for hours. He had a twinkle in his eyes and a twang in his voice and always told the funniest stories. 
This October will mark our fifth year without him...our soon-to-be 5-year-old twin daughters never got a chance to know their Uncle Steve, but I talk about him often and they know he loved them very much. 
I honor him by speaking out about suicide."

He loved to entertain, and he was so compassionate to everyone. PJ was The Cowardly Lion in his first grade production of The Wizard of Oz. Duringhis song and dance number, part of his costume fell off. Without missing a beat, he picked it up and continued. As an adult, he joined the Army,and  served two tours in Iraq, one of which earned him a Purple Heart. His fellow soldiers loved him. He would literally drop everything to help a brother in uniform. Once, he even cancelled a date with a girl to pick up a fellow soldier from the airport and bring him home to his unsuspecting family. Since his death, more than one of the men he served with has let my family know that PJ was the one who brought themselves out of a dark place.

He couldn't do it. He couldn't see the small joys in a normal existence,  the everyday something,  the everyday anything that brings a smile, however small. A genuine feeling of joy. They don't last forever,  those joys.  They're often fleeting, and if we blink, we'll miss many of them. But they're there, and sometimes they're all we have to remind ourselves that it's worth going on. It's worth living for. Tomorrow will bring more of these,  and I want to see what moments tomorrow brings. I tried to remind Kevin of these moments,  I grasped at straws when he talked about how close he was to ending it all.  When I think back on it, I could have done so much more, said so much more. I wonder if he thought about what a legacy of guilt and pain he was leaving for his sisters,  his nieces and nephews,  his step dad. Our mom died 22 hours after Kevin took his life from heart failure.  She never knew. My family is devastated.  It's not even been five months.  It feels like yesterday.

Our love for Edgar Allan Poe, horror movies, reading, quirky kitschy knickknacks, Marilyn Monroe, the 50's, rescue animals etc (we really were each other's other half) could keep us talking for hours.

He was the kid in school that tried to make everyone fee comfortable and was always smiling.  He stood up for his friends and was very easy going.  He always claimed that he wasn't very popular but that was okay with him.  He liked to think of himself as antisocial and like to do things quietly on his own.  However, he loved to play football and do well at track.  Any time we were out in public kids from the school would come up to him and say hello by name and talk with him.  Whenever they would leave I would ask who they were and he would always say that he was in class with them or they went to school.  It always amazed me how many people felt comfortable talking with him even though he ""wasn't very popular"".  When Patrick went to college he didn't have the amazing community around him that he had become so used to to give him support.  He was truly a ""loner"" and was having a hard time fitting in and succeeding.  So this amazing person went from happy and content to in the darkest place of his life in a matter of months and didn't see a way out without disappointing his family.  He made the crushing decision that his life was not as important to us as his success.  We will forever regret that he felt that way.  If this can happen to a person as content and happy as Patrick, it can happen to anyone."

He was a wonderful young man -- excellent grades, determination to succeed, and a bright future ahead.  His career interests were in neuroscience and entrepreneurship, and his most important hobby was music.  He was a skilled trumpet player in high school, and then he played with the Madison Scouts in DCI competition during the summer of 2011.  Most importantly to me, though, he was my son.  I loved him and loved spending time with him.  I miss seeing him play youth baseball.  I miss his band competitions.  I miss helping him with homework or discussing his possible career path.  I miss playing golf with him and taking vacations with him.  I miss our discussions of movies and TV shows.  But most of all, I just miss HIM.  I love you, Brian, and I can't wait to see you again some day.

She was a shining light to everyone she met, yet could never see that for herself.  She was the Ninja on the ice and off, she battled more than just the puck. She had a personality that made everyone who met her love her.  Her competitiveness on the ice was done as soon as the game was over, she reached out to other teams and made friends where ever she played.  She loved to help others, by coaching, teaching, or just listening.

I have always been her advocate and will continue to be an advocate for her and for others that need to find help.

I am grateful God gave her to us for the 17 years, 11 months, and 24 days, rest in peace my beautiful sunshine, may you never feel the pain again that made you need to leave us all. 

Brittany Patricia Rose March 29th, 1998 ‚Äì March 24th, 2016 the most important part to remember is the dash, the dash was everything she did to make her time with us count.

She made broken look beautiful and strong look invincible. She walked with the weight of the universe on her shoulders and made it look like a pair of wings.

Not a day goes by that you are not thought of. 
You had your troubles but we will never forget the beautiful person you were, I only wish you took a moment to really think your decision through. Wherever you are now I hope you are at peace. I promise to never let you be forgotten, to make sure your precious baby girl knows you for who you were not how you left and that you loved her more than anything in this world... I promise that I will make sure your nieces and nephew remember all the good times you all had and remind them of how much you loved them.  
This pain we carry will forever be in our hearts it will never get easy to bare, but the good memories and the fun times we shared are what will help us through the darker days.
Where ever it is you're hangin these days whether it is with Gramma or Elvis :) I hope you are having a blast, I hope you have them all cracking up like you had us, and I hope you're monkey smile is shining bright like it always did. I love you ReeRee, and I miss you more than words can describe.

He died on the same day he was born, October 2nd. He was a father to me and my 2 siblings, a husband of nearly 20 years to my mother, a brother to his many siblings, and a son, an uncle, a cousin, and so many other things. Above all, he was a great man. Not perfect, sometimes angry, emotionally abusive, overworked, underpaid, treated poorly, but still great. He gave more love back than he received. He did everything and sacrificed everything for his family. Sometimes he didn't understand why his family did certain things, why he did certain things, why I did certain things. But he taught me so much about life in the 15 years I was his son while he walked this earth, more than he'll ever know. There are some days where I'm glad he's gone. But everyday I wish I could take back everything good I've accomplished the past 8 years to let him know one last time that I loved him. R.I.P. Lieutenant Michael Pigott. I love you, dad.

He was in the midst of therapy after he learned the full truth of his father's death, also via suicide  (accidental). I always tried to make sure he knew that he would never be judged for the thoughts he couldn't control. Even while enduring and I realize now, downplaying a lot of his struggles, he was still able to extend himself and be a friend to so many. Hugging whenever he saw someone sad, giving shorter or younger people piggy back rides in the hallways....there isn't enough space to talk about him, I could go on forever.

I miss his laugh, his smile, his spirit. He fought. He tried. He was the best gift I ever had."

He loved taking things apart, exploring what makes them tick and trying to fix them. He loved writing poems. He loved brands such as Billabong and Hurley. Ryan likes to wear mismatched socks and his Oakley sunglasses on the back of his head. He kept his room a mess but somehow always knew where things were. He would spend hours upon hours on his computer watching YouTube videos and playing video games. Ryan love drinking Monster energy drinks and kept every pull tab on a necklace. He worked on his Mitsubishi Eclipse, making it as customized as possible. That car was his baby.

He wanted to be like his father in so many ways. He was going to school for Mechatronics to follow in his father's footsteps. He would have conversations with his dad about engineering, like circuit boards. He wanted to plant his life out just like his father did.

He had his mother's heart. He loved eternally just like she. He watched out for his mom, for health and her feelings. He cherished his chats and advice that he had with her. He watched over her when she needed something.

He was a big brother to his big sister. Protected her when she needed it. He was so happy to show her new things he got or what he was doing. She might have embarrassed him in his lifetime, but what are sisters for? He appreciated having someone watch over him protecting him.

He had so many lives that he touched while he was on this earth. He met amazing people that brighten his day. Those people made him smile, made him laugh, and brought out a side of him that only a few were blessed to ever see. He recently made a new family at Best Buy. Those people made his nights bright and cheerful. He loved working with them and taking some of the funniest pictures he has ever taken. Those friends have blessed his life and forever has blessed his family with their fond memories of him.

Ryan left too soon. He was one of the strongest, most caring man that ever blessed this world. But his pain grew too much to bear. No one knew how much, no one knew for how long, no one could have seen this coming. He would want people to know that he didn't mean this, that it wasn't anyone's fault. God called him home to take away his pain. He is now under God's wings to watch over everyone."

Jonathan  had such a horrible sense of humor, but he would get so tickled at his own jokes that you couldn't help but laugh right along with him. I like to remember his laugh when I think of him. One day we were sitting on the boat dock at his family's cabin. I was sitting down in my lawn chair when it collapsed on me. I think he was stunned for a minute. He just looked at me and I said, ""Thanks for your help, but I got it""....then we both started laughing.

Although David had been lent to us for only a brief moment in time, he had touched countless lives & has had a profound effect on our souls‚Ä¶he was a precious gift to us unlike any other. 

He lived his life with curiosity & enthusiasm; seizing every moment & infusing passion & his quirky sense of humour into everything he did.

David held steadfast in his beliefs & stood up for others in need; always offering a helping hand or a compassionate word & above all...acceptance. We will continue to ensure his voice is heard & let others know they are not alone."

I remember my dad as someone who was much loved and who's laugh could make anyone else laugh. We would often quote movies, lines so miniscule only we would understand. I miss his laugh everyday, I miss calling him up to rant about my day or hear about his. He taught me how to tie my shoes, ride a bike, how to cook, how to be a good person who cares for others. He may have had his demons, but he was good enough. He was always good enough. It hurts me everyday to live without him. I want anyone struggling with ideation to know that you are good enough and people do care more than you know.

He could make the best hamburgers,  and as you can tell from this picture,  mash potatoes.   This picture was taken at Thanksgiving,  when he and I were determined to not run out of mashed potatoes.   We pealed, cooked, and mashed about 12 lbs. of potatoes,   and we did have enough.

He became a First Responder at the very young age of 14, as a volunteer Firefighter. He became an EMT at age 16.  He went on to become a Paramedic and Paid Firefighter.  He was dedicated and compassionate and wanted nothing more than to help anyone in need. His laugh and silly antics were also a big part of him.  He loved fishing and hunting.  He would spend an entire day at camp fishing, from daybreak to nightfall.  He left me with a broken heart but also with a large extended ""family"" who have surrounded me with love and caring.

To the man who was our whole world,
 We wish we could say I love you, We wish you could have stayed,
 But it was your time to go.. and there was no other way.
 We wish we could just hug you, or could give you one last kiss.
 And show you all the things about you that we all really miss.
 We just wasn't ready to let you go and wasn't even a choice,
 What we wouldn't do right now that we could  just to hear your voice.
We all  know your always with us, your hand upon ourback,
 and whispering the words of encouragement to help us stay on track.
 Your memory is a candle that burns deep insideour heart, 
 and for that same reason we can never be apart.

He was 34 years old and left behind children ages 9 and 14.  We miss him so very much. He was the most kindess, gentle, loving, and caring person in this world. His undiagnosed bipolar changed him into someone I didn't know. He could have been saved if I could have force treatment but I couldn't. So now the world is less one awesome person. Me and the kids miss him so much!!! May he rest in peace

God gave me the best father I could've asked for. Our relationship was rough at time, bumping heads about small things, but one thing is certain: he only wanted what is best for me. Hindsight is 20/20. He left the world on a beautiful spring morning, making sure I wasn't the one who would find him. Wrote me the most beautiful letter that explained as best as he could what he was going through. He never told me what he was experiencing behind closed doors, I was his baby girl and he thought he had to be strong for me at all times. Ohh what I would tell him now. He would be so proud of who I've become. I'm not the brash little teenager that gave him so much trouble anymore, I'm a grown woman and pursuing my goals before anything else just like he taught me. God would he love who I am now, sometimes I wish he stuck around to see how I turned out. But I know his pain was too unbearable, and he tolerated it for years. He's free of that now, my old sailor in heaven. I can only look back and feel blessed that he taught me everything he did, even if at the time I was too ignorant to listen. The pain doesn't get better with time, but I know someday we will meet again. He has shown me signs that he's out there, watching over me. I'm sure others on here have felt and seen the signs too. My life will never be the same without him, but the good memories we made and years I had with him were nothing to be looked over.  My one and only dad. Just like you used to tell me, every day I miss you like the sun.

Debra had a beautiful personality she was such a beautiful, humble soul. She was the mother of three very beautiful daughters. The Depression started the addiction and within just a couple of years the addiction took her out. People let's save our babies. let's spread awareness to this huge issue in the world today.

His zest for life was contagious and his gift was to help others shine and feel valued. Luke‚Äôs million-dollar smile and impulsive nature always brought laughter and joy to those who knew him.

Luke expressed himself through music and represented the 3rd generation on his mother‚Äôs side to enjoy playing the guitar. He also enjoyed playing many sports and was a natural at baseball but had a passion for lacrosse. He deeply admired his older brother who helped him pave his path and believe in himself. Luke came from a loving and supportive household and aspired to work in law enforcement like his father and hero. He was smart, compassionate, and blessed with many friends and family.

Like many 14-year-old young men, Luke struggled with pressures and developmental changes that set his emotions ablaze. His normal laid-back personality was, at times, overshadowed by these new stormy clouds that Luke struggled to control. He was not depressed. He was not withdrawn. He was not bullied. He was a 14-year-old boy enduring a heavy burden to please others and meet outside expectations while going through natural changes that made his emotions intense and hard to control and without the brain development to sort it all out. On a normal Sunday morning, when he was confronted with a workable challenge that arose from making a common teenage mistake, Luke panicked. The swirling emotional clouds raged an out of control storm in his mind and Luke impulsively took his own life. Blinded to the truth and fooled by the darkness of the moment, he reacted without thinking about the consequences of his actions. Had he only realized that the storm would have passed if given a little time."

7/20/1991-6/12/2016

A beautiful soul, Christopher James Cordova, left this word, far too soon, on June 12th, 2016. He took with him, a piece of our hearts that can never be replaced. Chris came into our lives on July 20th, 1991. Our sweet baby boy filled our lives with such joy.

Chris was always a free spirit with a great sense of humor. He loved fishing and camping with his¬†Dad and his best friend and brother, Michael. He taught himself to play the guitar and bass and played by ear; not by reading music. He was a talented artist and loved to draw. Chris was very articulate when he spoke, sometimes adding many colorful words. You could never stay mad at him for very long, because he would always end up making you laugh about it later. He was a friend to everyone, no matter what their status was. He always made people feel important.

Chris was a hard worker who started working at Sutherlands at the age of 14. Oh, how he hated watering all those plants! After graduating from Carbon High in 2009, he worked for Chrysalis for¬†two years, taking care of young people with disabilities. He was so compassionate and had a special way of connecting with them.

Chris worked for the Department of Public Safety and was a compassionate, caring, and professional dispatcher. He received many commendations for the way he handled emergency calls. After being there for two years, he knew that he wanted to become a police officer. Following in his father's footsteps, he graduated from the Utah Police Academy on December 20th, 2012. He was employed by the Price City Police Department for three and a half years, where he excelled in his duties and accomplishments and was praised and respected by many. He had a passion for helping people, no matter what their walk of life was. He always treated people with respect and dignity. We were so very proud of him.

Chris had an amazing relationship with his brother, Michael. They were inseparable as children and were¬†each other's best friend. They were each other's confidante as they grew into young¬†men. Though separated by miles, the past few years, they stayed connected by playing Xbox together. Chris was more than proud that Michael had asked him to be¬†his best man for his upcoming wedding. His physical presence will be sorely missed and irreplaceable. ""I sought my¬†soul, but my soul I could not see. I sought my God, but my God eluded me. I sought my brother, and I found all three."" Love, Michael.

On October 14th, 2013, Chris was diagnosed with Leukemia. Though he was scared, he remained strong for all of us. He was hospitalized for a long period of time, but always remained optimistic. His best memory was having Steve-O come and visit him. After a year, he was officially in remission but had to continue with monthly blood tests and oral chemo medication. With this came depression and anxiety. Still struggling with the effects of the Leukemia, his blood levels were continually fluctuating and he was hospitalized several more times. He suffered from severe headaches and only found relief with bed rest. Additionally, work issues, relationship problems, and countless bills resulted in a very stressful life.

Our boy was a fighter until the end while trying¬†to get a hold of his life. He was ready to start a new life. He was excited for it. We know he didn't want to leave, but sometimes the mind takes over the heart. ""Fly free baby, we will forever miss you. Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will.""

Between brokenhearted sobs I barely could distinguish  the words, ""Bubby's dead."" I didn't want to believe it; him and her we're always having fun and playing tricks, but it was real. He was such a fun loving guy who never seemed to let thing bring him down. I'd be losing my mind as work and he'd be quick to say, ""None of it mattered."" and would make me laugh with something silly. My wife put it best during the darkest part of our grief, ""He gave us lots of laughs and one big cry."" When I see him again I'm kicking his butt for this one. Miss ya, little bro."

To me, he was dad.  My most trusted advisor.  My biggest supporter and number one fan.  For as long as I can remember I had always been in his hip pocket, there was always an adventure to go on together.  Trips to the hardware store, window shopping for cars, and the father-daughter dates we always somehow managed to make time for, even when there was none.  We went everywhere and did everything together.  He always had my back and was there for me, even when he disagreed or didn't fully understand--but he always understood how much I needed him and he made sure to step up when it counted most.  No one ever expects to receive the news we've all at some point gotten, I know I never did.  The last time I saw my dad, I almost didn't; I was visiting from PA and was eager to get back on the road, but he woke up as I was leaving.  Thank God he did.  I got to hang out with my dad for hours, talking and laughing like to old friends.  No topic was off limits, and he even worked in how proud he was of me.  Did he know the end of the story?  Maybe, but even then he made sure I knew what I needed to and told me everything I would ever need to hear from him--he was proud of not only making my own way in the world, but of the person he had helped me become, and he made sure I knew just how much he loved me.  There will never be a day when I don't think of him, I'm sure, as I learn my new normal without him.  To everyone else, he was Bruce.  To me?  He was my dad, my biggest fan."

Before our graduation, or even middle school, he had been depressed and suicidal.
He talked to me about this and I lent an ear, always standing by his side.
I didn't know how to help him, but I provided as much love support as I could.

He was handsome, loving, a respectful gentleman, smart, witty and so talented. He had great empathy for others, especially the less fortunate. He could make us laugh with just an expression or silly dance move. He could draw and paint, sing and perform. He played soccer. He earned his first degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do at just ten years old. He loved music, many genres, from Frank Sinatra to Johnny Cash. He loved antiques, old movies and art. He had a great fondness of all things from the 40's and 50's. He had aspirations. He wanted to write a book. He wanted to help others like him. He wanted to create art to sell. He wanted to visit Los Angeles and many others. He loved food from southern fare to sushi. He never was a picky eater. He loved coffee and sweet tea. He loved a Krispy Kreme doughnut. A doughnut from Krispy Kreme, chocolate iced with sprinkles, became an annual birthday tradition; waking him up with one and one lit candle while singing Happy Birthday. He embraced other cultures, absorbed history and its facts like a sponge. He could hold an adult conversation from politics to religion. He loved God and the bible, his favorite subject, math, his least. He could tell you the stories of the bible as if he were there when they took place. He loved his family, friends and pets; Lily, our bunny and Annabelle, our cat. He loved our dogs, Andy and Ally from a distance, preferring the cat. He would have given everything to heal hearts and the world if he could. He was that generous of heart, but his illness and his death would not allow it. KSN 12/1/98- 2/20/16"

I knew Owen for nine years. We went to the same grade school, lived ten minutes from each other, and for the first couple of years, didn‚Äôt get along very well. I met him in third grade, and it took Owen and I until eighth grade to really start becoming friends. I left the Tarrytown/Sleepy Hollow school district in seventh grade to attend the Ursuline School in New Rochelle. In ninth grade, Owen left to attend Regis in Manhattan, and then a year later, Fordham Preparatory in the Bronx. Owen and I were alike in many ways. We listened to the same music, watched the same movies, and laughed at similar jokes. We liked the same food, cheered for the same sports teams, and even shared the same favorite number. We built upon our similar tastes and started to understand each other and connect on a much deeper level. After three years of real friendship with Owen, I knew him more than I even knew myself. However, I was not the only person profoundly affected by Owen Kelly. Owen made his way into my family. My sister loved him like a brother, and my parents loved him like a son. Because he‚Äôd been to three entirely different schools, he had made many friends from all over the country. Maybe it was his loud voice, or his hilarious laugh, or his compassionate smile, but the truth of the matter was that once you met Owen, you could not forget him.

His truck he worked hard on to master the look that made everyone want to ride with him. I hold my memeories of him as they should be with warm tears and cold sweet tea just the way he liked my tea.

Never did I think this would happen to my family and I, but it did and now it is our reality. It hasn't really gotten easier but we've have learned to cope. Suicide is such a horrible thing and although we may not understand why it happens, it does and I feel more people need to be aware of this. My dad was an amazing person and he was more knowledgeable about so many things than anyone I knew. He was a mechanic during the day and was a handyman on the side. Whenever anyone needed help with anything, you could count on my dad to be there. For instance, there was a day my boyfriend and I were trying to put up a ceiling fan but had some difficulties. I called my dad to see if he could help and he drove about 45 minutes just to help us do that. That was him all the time. He always had to be doing something and keeping busy. We weren't the happiest of families and we had our struggles but we were a family and made it through the tough times. My dad was so proud of my brother, sister, and I and supported us with the decisions we made whether he agreed with us or not. One thing he always told us was to never give up and never say ""I can't"". I am a college student and everyday I tell myself to not give up because that's what my dad would tell me. For anyone who has gone through any situation like mine, just remember it wasn't your fault and I even have to remind myself that daily. I hope that anyone who can relate to my story knows that you are not alone in this struggle. Thank you!"

He had a personality that was larger than life. His smile was sincere and could light up a room. He was a talented artist who brought life to his own struggles with the hope that it might inspire others to confront their own struggles. I will continue to be open and transparent with his struggles and my own so that others may find support and understanding, and know they are not alone. His dog was a source of joy who was by his side for many rough days and I feel honored to be by hers until she gets to see him again.

She was a proud Texan and she adored the Texas wildflowers that grew everywhere. She was slightly obsessed with armadillos and her laugh was the most contagious of them all. She had brown eyes that she said looked like mud, but always reminded me of chocolate. She was a feminist and taught me that I could run just as fast as the boys in class and that I could have the world if I worked hard enough. How I hated when she told me I had to finish my fruit instead of letting me go off and play. How I hated that I had to brush my hair and take baths every day. How I hated that she wouldn't let me stay out with my friends past midnight or have friends sleep over on school nights. How I thought she never understood me or knew what I was going through. Truth is, she did it all because she loved me; and I understand that now. Now all I hate is that I was robbed of telling her that I loved her for doing those things I hated so much. How I can't tell her that I know what she's going through and to let me be there for her for once. I was robbed of being able to be an adult and say I was thankful for everything she did for me, every sacrifice. She was my blessing from God. She was my rock and my best friend. She was my mom. Words will never be strong enough to capture who she was and what she meant to me."

He emphasized awareness in his life through the quality of food and water we put in our body, the environmental responsibility we take for granted, and the posture and manner of movement with which we use our bodies. A passionate nature lover, athlete and genuinely warm human, Andrew was a warrior loved by all lucky enough to be in his presence.  In the last few years, Andrew suffered from undiagnosed Lyme disease and the adverse physical as well as mental health issues that are common with this disease.  Ultimately, his strength diminished, Andrew chose to leave this world.  Andrew lived a courageous, generous, loving and beautiful life.  He is and will always be forever loved by us.

I was born 4/28/97. I loved the outdoors, fishing, hunting, music, video games, my family and my friends. Sadly, on 12/2/11, I felt very overwhelmed and like I had no choice but to start a new life in heaven.

Zach was authentically himself regardless of what any other kids were doing. I respected him for that as it's all too rare. He could do tv impressions so well, sometimes I swore the tv was still on. He loved bear hugs (the sort where he picks you up) and making people laugh. Zach loved to surprise people with thoughtful gifts and would look for ways he could share. It did not matter if it was a bag of chips or a donation box, he just loved to share. We shared a wishing star that I still use and hope sometimes he does too.

Losing Zach deeply affected all who know and love him. He is in our hearts and thoughts every day. There is a before and an after, it is never the same."

Victoria touched so many lives and was truly loved beyond words.  Her life was cut short, and the world lost a young beautiful person.  Victoria was a bright, kind spirited young woman who succeeded at everything she attempted. She was very smart, she loved school and valued the lessons that would help her succeed in the real world. She graduated high school with honors and was 1 yr away from receiving her nursing degree. When Victoria told us she wanted to go to nursing school, we knew that was her calling.  She thoroughly enjoyed helping people.  Even though my sister was a brilliant person and like to solve problems on her own, I always looked out for her. I admired Victoria. As an older sister you feel like you have to set an example for your younger siblings. They watch everything you say or do. They look up to you. But Victoria did that for me. I looked up to my little sister. I admired her. She was the most confident person I knew. She was WAY more fashionable then me. I remember always asking her If I could wear something of hers. Usually she said no. Which would make me irritated of course because her clothes were so much nicer than mine. She was always put together, she didn't need a reason to do her hair or makeup. She just did. She was outgoing and beautiful. When she entered a room, she brightened it up. She didn't have to speak; she just had to be there, and everyone felt at ease Victoria was such a thoughtful person who went out of her way to help anyone.  Some of you don't know me, but for those of you that do, know how much i love animals. I'll never forget the time Victoria helped me adopt my dogs. We had just lost our childhood dogs, Jack and Daisy. And it was a very sad time for me especially. Well time went by and I decided that it would be ready to get a new dog. My mother told me I could only get one.  I couldn't go the pound and get just one. Victoria knew that too, she knew how hard I had struggled with the loss of my dogs.  So she came with me to pick out a dog with my boyfriend. And if course I fell in love with 2 dogs.  So Victoria agreed to go in on a story to tell mom how these dogs were friends and we couldn't separate them and ect. Of course the icing on the cake was that they were pound puppies and looked so sad as it is.  Little to say we brought both dogs home I guess looking back on that story and even when it was all happening I knew her intentions were just to simply help me.  I knew from the day our lab, Jack died .she ran out of the clinic crying and came back and asked my mom if she could get me a puppy.  she truly cared for me because I was hurting and just wanted to help. She helped anyone and everyone she met.  I was told that Just a couple of weeks ago Victoria took a homeless woman to a restaurant and told her to get something to eat.  That was just the type of person she was Looking back at all the memories we shared growing up, it saddens me to know there won't be any more memories to make with her. There will only be memories that we had already created. I will truly miss knowing that she was here. All I ever wanted was a sister. A sister who you could grow old with and exchange mothering tips, a sister that you could joke with at family functions; a sister who would be your best friend till the very end. It is so sad that Victoria's life ended so early in such a tragic way. It's hard to accept that she'll no longer be with us. She had a loving family and friends and was on track to have a brilliant career. No one was prepared for this tragedy and it can be hard to understand how life works. She'll forever be with us in our hearts. We will all be proud of her accomplishments and never forget how wonderful of a person she was.  Victoria we all love and miss you. God Bless."

He had a huge heart, was very funny and very smart.He always put others first.He told me and his father that he loved us every day and gave us big hugs.
Unlike most people Tyler did not show obvious outward signs that he was in trouble. I feel teen pressures and the struggle to fit in / not feeling good enough for others was too much for him.
I hope everyone ,kids and adults alike, will stop and think the next time they judge someone and appreciate the beauty that is our differences.

She was so full of life, always smiling, friends with everyone, my best friend. No one knew she was hiding the secret her live in BF was physically and emotionally hurting her, broke her spirit down to where she felt she was nothing. He hit her one night and told her to go kill herself that she was nothing. She did just that. It kills me that he not only broke her down from the full of life bubbly girl that had everything going for her, but that she really believed she was nothing and did just what he said. I miss her more than words can ever say. That dark moment can take away everything, not just from them, but from family and friends as well, nothing will ever be the same. My baby is at peace with her turmoil now and one day we will meet again, until then, my struggle of pain without her continues.

I'm Trenton's mom... one of the proudest titles I own.

His father and I call him Trenty. We were the only ones aloud this privilege :)

Trenton has three brothers. His older brothers are wild and it took a while to realize that our Trenty was a very shy child. (With his brothers he was fearless.)He held his worries close. he felt others pains deeply. he's the true meaning of a tender heart.

He's an amazing artist. The art he created was a true extension of himself. powerful and honest. full of struggle and humor.

He shyness never held him back. He found his voice. he did hard things. he gave strength to those around him. to stood up for what he felt was right. He spoke out for what he felt to be wrong. It was never easy for him but he chose to do it anyway.

People were drawn to him. If he called you friend. it was truth in its most honest form. there was nothing fake or forced from this beautiful boy of mine. he held my heart in every way.

As a small child he would love to go on ""treasure hunts"". he would search for out of place items along the side of roads and on trials. things that were out of place. he would collect them and keep them in his treasure boxes. and sometimes give them away. I hold several as my dearest positions.

These boxes seem to sum up my Son. (If there is really such a real way to do for such a complicated and stunning individual.) Trent has the talent to see what others miss. to look past of obvious. to see the random and its beauty. to see and feel it in other person. To not only see it but to cherish it. to bring it too light. to put value where others might have seen none. He has a gift. that gift I think took a toll. he also felt the pains of others. and did not see how he could help or change that for another. he felt it personally.

As honest as he was. As in touch with so much. he was so lost in his own thoughts. he coudnt find a way to release the pain. he couldn't see the help and support around him. he didn't feel anyone could ever understand. im not sure we could ever understand but I believe there was a way to hold him. carry him through tell he found a new way to stand. I never gave up. I tried to get him help in every way. but it wasn't enough to save him."

Even though he was a very strong young man, having his heart broke tragically overcame him. He spent his last two years of his high school life trying to make sure his girlfriend was happy. Begging him to move with her, he quit his job, moved 200 miles away from his family, got a new job, a place of his own and was looking forward to a happy life together with her. They had looked at wedding rings, he had planned his proposal, and they had talked about their futures together. After being there for 2 weeks, she told him she didnt love him anymore and wanted to move on. The freedom she was experiencing away from her mother, had changed her as a person. Trenton suffered from depression, a suicide attempt, spent time in the hospital as well as an in-patient treatment center. When he was released he assured us he was better. We prayed and talked with him, trying to reassure him things would get better. I found a letter the day after he ended his life. He was telling us all how much he loved us and how much we all meant to him. He ended the letter with ""sometimes you just can‚Äôt live with a broken heart"" His last words to me the night before were ""I Love You Too"" Even though he was 18, he always told his mom he loved me. I just never dreamed it would be the last time I heard it. He has so many friends and family members that love and miss him deeply. I just wish he would have seen that before he decided to take his life. This has destroyed me but I know I have to stay strong for his sisters. We love you Trenton!! Until we meet again...."

He fought and suffered a physically debilitating disease called RSD. RSD attacks your sympathetic nervous system, causing increased pain that slowly claims your limbs. My dad was in imaginable pain for over 8 long years. He was prescribed a lot of narcotic pain meds, along with benzodiazepines and anti depressants. About a year before his suicide, he started talking to my siblings and I about it, trying to let us make peace with him and telling each of us how much he loved us and what he admired most about us. He struggled and fought against what he saw as his only way out of his pain. He succumbed to that permanent relief November 17, 2006. He is loved and greatly missed by many."

by The Fray

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking His last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything.""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, You found me

In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I want to be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Early morning
The city breaks
I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

My Dad was smart and funny and handsome. He was a veteran, went to Vietnam. He had a hard life but a great sense of humor. He used to call me the ""apple of his eye"" and a ""chip off the old block"". He never treated me like a girl, I was one of the boys haha. Dad, I can't believe it's been 10 years, you loved your family more than anything and we miss you. I love you.

Suicide seems to run in my family as my Dad's Dad (my grandfather) also committed suicide and this had a detrimental effect on my Dad as a 16-year-old, no doubt. Mental illness is a real thing, it took me a long time to understand this. My Dad lived a life of pain, a hidden shameful pain that no one could ease and no one understood. He was an alcoholic, he struggled with depression, insecurity and self destructive behaviors. If only he had known how much we loved him and realized that he deserved to be loved. If only he had loved himself. People who commit suicide are their own harshest critics, often thinking they are not worthy to live.

For anyone here struggling with suicidal thoughts (I have battled this, I understand) and looking for hope, know that there is always hope. God is with you. There is help out there, believe in yourself. God would not have created you if you were not worthy to live, if you were not loved. You don't yet understand your own value, your purpose. But you will. Know that."

Russell Eugene Boog came to us on February 16th 1989. He was a little spit fire from the beginning! So cute and lovable and a pain in the butt all wrapped up in one!
I have so many stories about the little fart but I will only share a few. Then I would love to hear about some of the good time you all have shared with him.
Just about a month ago Russell broke his phone. I asked what happened. ‚ÄúWell Mom you know how you can put a phone in airplane mode?‚Äù I said yes. ‚ÄúWell Phones really can‚Äôt fly!‚Äù My advice to you is not to test this out for yourself.
How many of you didn‚Äôt know subway does not have Ketchup? Well I think Russell was 6 when he found out. He wanted some on his ham and cheese sandwich. Boy was he mad. I don‚Äôt think he ate lunch that day! I got mad the other day when Robert told me something he seen on Facebook about tomatoes ‚Ä¶..If tomatoes are a fruit then isn‚Äôt ketchup a Smoothie! I wanted to share this with Russell.
When he did things he liked to do them big! We were living in Ogallala when he was out playing with the neighbor kids when his sister came in asking for some pliers as I was on the phone with my mom. I started to look for them but decided to ask why? Oh Russell has a fish hook in his finger. I made Amber go get Russ. Sure enough a hook was in his finger! A Great big Lure was attached to it! About 2 inches long it was!! Russell just wanted the pliers like we did when we were fishing. He didn‚Äôt cry till we said he had to go to the DR. to get it out.
Russell could always make you laugh. His heart was big and made of gold. I been reading most of what was wrote on Facebook by all of you, his friends. Thank you. You made me laugh, you made me cry. You made me happy and sad. Most of all you let me see how loved Russell is and that helps heal my Heart.
Exodus 23:20 ‚ÄúBehold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared.
Russell has wrote a few thing that he wanted us know. He wanted us to rejoice in that fact that he has his wings now. For us not to be sad. He asked that we not blame ourselves for the pain, and that he is happy and waiting for us on the other side. He wrote this is his happy ending and he went silently into the night feeling no pain.
Russell did request that his ashes be spread in a beautiful place where the Elk and the Deer Feed.
I leave you with the last thing he wanted read should we ever have to put him to rest.
Russell Says ‚ÄúThank you all for the wonderful things you have taught me. I hope I have taught you something as well. Like a thousand different commanders on a thousand different battle fields I await for the dawn. Love you all.‚Äù"

Healing for me was difficult and postponed because suicide wasn't something you spoke freely about. There weren't support groups, fb pages, or awareness walks suicide not only brought along a mass confusion of feelings but also a lot of shame. My father's suicide was something I wouldn't even acknowledge and in the beginning and for many years that followed when someone asked how my father died I responded with a heart attack. In my late 20's I found a support group that would change my life. I started attending Survivors of Suicide meetings in Albuquerque and for the 1st time in my life I was relieved. I met a group of ""strangers"" who listening to them talk about their feelings and thoughts could have been my own. I will forever be grateful to the SOS group of Abq for giving me a safe place to just sit, talk, listen and heal. My husband and I will be walking in the Out of the Darkness Walk in Abq this weekend to honor the memory of my father. I'm very thankful to have this opportunity to join others whose lives have been affected by suicide, to promote awareness and continue to  heal."

March 20, 2009, 3:10am the phone rang. It was my parents ... both of them were on the line ... telling me something that even five years later I still can't understand, and barely believe. They told me that Jed, my brother, was dead. He had killed himself. What?!?! How is it possible that Jed, the joker in every crowd, the ""party guy"" who instantly made friends with anyone and everyone, the world traveler, the chef, the ""I can fix anything"" guy, the light and energy of every room, my big brother, could be gone? This was the beginning of a spinning, spiraling, roller coaster search for answers to a question I'll never truly be able to answer. Why?

Nearly five months later, through a haze of indescribable grief, I was walking into an appointment with my hair stylist and what I saw stopped me cold. It was a poster for a walk to prevent suicide! I walked into the salon on very shaky legs, but I knew that I was going to participate in that walk. Five months to-the-day after Jed died, I dragged my mom with me to my first walk planning meeting. It was surreal. But it was the most welcoming group of understanding people I'd ever met! They hugged me and welcomed me into the club that none of us ever wanted to join.

Through our pain and grief my mom and I, with the incredible support of our family, did what we ""do."" We jumped right in to help organize and plan an event. It gave us something to focus on, something positive to put our energy into, something to keep us putting one foot in front of another.

One month later we held the walk. There I became a survivor.

It was at the walk where I met and grew close with other survivors who knew and fully understood my pain, and where I realized that I am not alone in this loss. I was able to take a deep breath (for the first time in months) and see, through other survivors stories, that I could make it through another day ... another month ... another year ... one moment at a time. I began to understand that suicide loss is so much bigger than I could ever have imagined and I knew at that moment my mission would be to save one sister from suffering through what I had survived. Sometimes in tragedy we find our life's purpose.

Over the next year I met other survivors, I continued to heal, I helped plan another walk, and began to lay the foundation to form the Utah Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). On October 15, 2010, with my mom by my side as a board member, our chapter became official. In 2012 my brother Erik joined the board of the Greater Minnesota Chapter of AFSP, making us a multi-chapter AFSP Family.

Over the past five years I have learned more about suicide prevention and mental illness than I ever thought possible. I have shared in others' loss and I have helped to spread suicide awareness and messages of HOPE! I realize that I will never have the answer to my question of ""why"" but I know that because of my loss I will help save lives. I will continue moving forward knowing that my sacrifices and service will ensure that other sisters will never have to feel this pain. I will continue to help save lives!

He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was only 19 months old. Growing up with diabetes was a continuous struggle.

He was a stubborn child. He did not like school, although he was very intelligent. I was told by the school system he was an angry child when he was in grade school. He went through ""anger management"" classes in school. He learned how to control his anger better, but there was still something ""not right"".

As he progressed in school, he began to care less and less about everything, except video games and TV. He spent every waking hour either playing games or watching TV. (Most of the time doing both).

I tried to get him involved in anything. In grade school I started him in Tiger Cubs and he continued into Cub Scouts, but couldn‚Äôt get him to stay interested in it. He played baseball in 2nd and 3rd grade. He decided he wanted to retire from that because he was so small the pitchers couldn‚Äôt pitch to his strike zone and he was hit with pitches all the time. We couldn‚Äôt get him to join the team the next year.

He tried bowling for a few years, but when his team fell apart he didn‚Äôt want to bowl with kids he didn‚Äôt know. I said that would be a great way to meet new friends. His father and I also decided that since he was in High School, we were not going to just give him money every week. He would have to earn it. (By doing chores around the house) We couldn‚Äôt get him to pursue a job, so I tried to get him to take some responsibilities this way. He chose to quit bowling. His father and I talked about just giving him the money for bowling because at least he was getting out of the house, but that‚Äôs when he decided he didn‚Äôt want to bowl anymore. And we couldn‚Äôt change his mind.

He never found that ""something"".

His school work suffered - well, he didn't do the work. The teachers would tell me he would pass if he would do the work - they knew he was capable, but he didn't care to do the work. And would tell the teachers.

I took him to counselors and he was finally diagnosed and he was placed on medication for depression.

His school work continued to suffer, and his father and I decided to let him quit school, as long as he would go for his GED, (he had not passed all his 10th and 11th grade classes to move on to graduate)

It took us a year to get him to take the GED test, which he passed with no problem. April 7th, 2011.

On May 8th 2011 , Mother‚Äôs Day, I went to his room about 11AM to check on him and spoke to him about some issues. We ended up arguing. I told him we would talk later when Dad would get home. That was the last conversation I had with him.

It pains me whenever I read of a tragic suicide, but that is redundant:each one is tragic. The loss of life, the pain for the family , the missed opportunities. I only pray that the word spreads and awareness is raised and one by one some lives are saved."

He gave the best hugs ever and he always made you feel good!  He loved to sing, dance and act in theater.  He was proud to be a Winooski Firefighter.  He was a wonderful son, brother and uncle.  A great friend to many.  He was the consoler when you were down.  He would cheer you on to accomplish what you were trying to do.  He was a hardworker. He loved spaghetti and he loved ice cream and frozen yogurt.  There are no words to describe the loss we all feel. We miss him so much and we will keep his memory alive every day.

He was diagnosed posthumously as having Bipolar 2. Knowing nothing about the mental health world, I looked everywhere for information and help with making sense of what happened, and to do my best to heal from it, while helping my children process as well. I found AFSP and other organizations that gave me specific tools and information with all of it. Sharing my story with many others has been very cathartic and helpful in many ways. I honor Nick in helping others on a daily basis in some capacity.

Neal was the greatest brother, father, son, uncle, husband and friend. He was a caring and compassionate man who sought to take away the pain of others in any way he knew how. He had a wonderful dry sense of humor that, with that sly smile of his, could turn nearly any thought or situation into comedy.  He also gave the tightest hugs.  He would envelop you in those overly long arms of his and wrap you in warmth.  Unfortunately, he cared for those around him  more than himself. He struggled with a chronic alcohol addiction, and seemingly, a number of factors evolving from that abuse led to his depression and eventually his taking his life. He was 45. Though it has been more than three years since his death, his family continues to struggle with his decision and with the loss they feel in their lives. And we miss his hugs. It's still hard to believe he is gone."

In my wildest dreams I would have never thought I would be living through this last year. It has been devastating, life altering, hard. I lie awake at night with all these unanswered questions and this image of him I can't get out of my head. I have tried to use my faith...my strength, anything to move in a forward direction...but the questions just keep coming. Why??? The biggest one. Why did you choose to leave me? I bet there isn't a survivor out there who doesn't ask that single question. And it will remain forever unanswered. I pray and pray for any kind of answer that will heal my heart, make me remember the good times, make me feel even a sliver of ""normal"". Nothing feels normal, nothing feels ""real""....except the pain. That is so real. The loss, that's real. As the anniversary comes around next week, all the ground  I have traveled in this last year seems to be slipping away, and along with it, my momentum forward. It is a work in progress and I feel like this time every year will be tough....and I will struggle again. Until my tears are replaced with smiles.........‚ô°"

Due to major depression and feeling like he did not belong, It really made his life Hard. Growing up he was always depressed, he would have his good days and bad days.

His business was failing. he could not manage his bills. The so-called system failed him! It just got to much for him to handle. Little did we know he would take his own life.

I did all I could to help him try to find ways to cope.  But I too feel like I failed him.

I remember him coming back and telling me what happened. But he use to always let on that he was fine because I would ask him daily after we graduated. He was my best friend, he was like my brother. We talked daily even tho we didn't hang out much. He was always there for me and he understood me so much. We had so much in common and losing him changed my world. I lost the person I turned too for everything I lost the one person who understood me. I had lost my grandma just weeks before and he was helping me get through that, but he's not here to help me get through this. After losing him I go involved with AFSP in his honor and memory. I didn't want anyone else to feel that pain that I did and to feel alone in their journey. It's been three years and I still miss him daily but it's gotten better and I'm still volunteering with AFSP hoping I can change at least one persons life.

He was a Vietnam Vet and a very well educated dentist, a father of 2, grandfather of 1.   He struggled a lot with depression, I believe mostly over the loss of our cousin Johnny in Vietnam in 1967.  Survivors guilt ?  We were very proud of his accomplishments.  It was very hard for all of us that loved him to see his daily pain.  Seemed like life knocked him down so many times but he was so strong and got right back up with each struggle.  He talked about suicide so many times over the years that when it finally happened it was such a shock.  We just didn't think he'd ever follow through.  Now it's our turn for the survivors guilt .. we miss him so much, and wish like hell we could have saved him.

""I cannot promise he will stay; since all from earth return,
But there are lessons taught down there I want this child to learn.
I've looked the wide world over in My search for teachers true
And from the throngs that crowd life's lanes I have chosen you.
Now will you give him all your love, not think the labor vain,
Nor hate Me when I come to call to take him back again?""
""I fancied that I heard them say, ""Dear Lord, Thy will be done!
For all the joy Thy child shall bring, the risk of grief we run.
We'll shelter him with tenderness, we'll love him while we may,
And for the happiness we've known, forever grateful stay;
But should the angels call for him much sooner than we've planned,
We'll brave the bitter grief that comes and try to understand!""

Michael was our only son, our baby. With his death by suicide, we lost a part of ourselves, our hopes, our dreams, our future, the end of the family name. We lost a friend, a helper, a sense of humor, a father, a musician with hopes and dreams, a carpenter. A part of us was entwined in that rope with Michael.

Not a day passes but what we don't think of him. The depth of our loss is visible in our faces, the pain lining our every cell. We've stopped asking why and try to focus on preventing others from the same thing. Our wounds have not healed, they have scarred over with layers of memories of Michael."

2nd Class Petty Officer Matthew Trojahn was the youngest of three sons born to Scott and Dawn Trojahn.  He was a bright young man, a self taught musician and songwriter, and a friend to everyone he met.  Most importantly, he loved to laugh, and he loved to make other people laugh.  His laugh was infectious.  On August 29, 2013 all of that changed when a Navy chaplain  came to his parents door.  The depression and darkness that Matt had been dealing with had overpowered him, and he was gone.  In the weeks that followed after his death, his parents death, his parents received many calls and messages from people, many they did not know, whose lives had been touched  by Matt.  For his family and friends, there will always be a sadness for the loss of Matt.  But we also hold tight to the beautiful memories he left us with.  And we will continue to bring depression and suicide prevention to the forefront.  Many of us have participated in Out of the Darkness walks. not just for Matt, but for everyone.  Rest in Peace, Matthew Trojahn.  Your job on earth is done.  We will continue the fight."

Matt, four years my junior, battled with alcoholism since his early teens. When he was 18, my father left us and told me to take care of my mother and brother. Those are the days that were dark...bailing him out of jail, blackouts, police showing up. Nevertheless, he was my little brother and the worse it ever got was me banishing him to the garage. Even as an alcoholic he adored my two children and they loved their uncle! He read to them, cooked for them, and being a single mom, he helped me out enormously. But there were always the suicide threats and attempts. I would always manage to talk him out of them. On one of his suicide attempts, he awoke to what he thought was God, but was a police officer who helped him up, took him home and told him he needed to get help. Matt went into AA the following day, and immersed himself in the AA program. It was 2003 and the kids and I got to know a beautiful and sober uncle and brother.  He dedicated himself to aiding alcoholics morning, noon and night. He always kept blankets in the car for drunks laying in the downtown alleys. He would drag me along with him to hospitals to visit sick alcoholics. He was amazing! Everything horrible he had done in the past he had made amends to. He always told me ""Julie, if I ever pick up again I will be dead within a month."" He married in 2008 and by 2009 was laid off from his job and regretting his decision to marry. We talked. I told him to get out of the marriage (she wasn't supportive with his service work in AA) and come and live with me; after all, I had taken care of him most of his life. He became more withdrawn and depressed. He started acting strangely. I didn't know it, but he had started drinking again. On January 6, 2010, he drove out to the desert and took his life. My life ended that day too. I got a text that simply read ""I love you"". By the time I got it, it was too late. I still think every day that if he would have called me and started his suicide rants, that I could have talked him out of it as I did so many times throughout the years. I replay our conversation we had that night prior to his suicide in the wee hours of the next morning. My poor children..."

About Matt:

Matt was intelligent beyond his years. He was always trying to learn and understand even some of the weirdest things. He was a huge nerd at heart and geeked out when it came to electronics. Don't let that fool you though - because he was a huge socialite. When everyone was together, his main mission was to make sure people were having fun... even if that meant buying rounds for his friends and regretting the bar tab the next day. He loved to play practical jokes on people. Overall, he had a great sense of humor. His favorite movie was Oh Brother Where Art Thou? He could recite the whole movie and made the music on that movie his ringtone on his phone. He took pride in his family and was ALWAYS there to lend a hand to anybody that needed help. He LIVED for Nebraska football and would come home from games with no voice because he was screaming so loud. He never believed in sitting down at the games... you could find him in the student section. He was a handy man and loved going around fixing things. He always had a project he was working on and the weird part about it is that he loved it.

His Struggle:

A few people knew he was struggling with sleeping at night and was stressed out because he owned his own software company that he ran out of the basement of his home. He was very successful with his business, but he felt the pressure of needing to do everything himself in order to avoid mistakes and him having to fix them. He began to withdraw himself socially from people. At my brother's high school graduation party, he was noticeably irritable and did not want to be around people. A lot of times you would chalk something like that up to stress - which is something that everyone goes through. The last thing in your mind is wondering if this person will commit suicide because he seemed irritable at a party. Him taking his life was not his character and I know he would never mean to hurt his family the way he did.

He was a husband, a father, a son, a brother, an uncle, a ""papa"" and a friend to many who knew him. He meant everything to everybody. The world lost the most charismatic person on that day. I still wish there was something, anything that could have clued me in to the kind of pain he was suffering. He was completely fine the night before - laughing with the family and planning an upcoming trip to Chicago. He got up the next day and took his morning meds like he usually does, drove an hour away to his brother's farm and ended his life. Nothing would have indicated he was about to take his life. That's the hardest part about suicide - not getting any answers, therefore never getting any closure. I hope he knows how much he was loved here on Earth and what we would give to have him back. Some days are better than the rest. I don't feel like the pain of suicide diminishes - I believe we just get stronger. Until we meet again."

She was my best friend, mentor, and hero from the day I was born.  A little less than nine years ago, when she was 30, she took her life.  It seemed unfathomable.  Although she was under a lot of stress, she had always been the strong one, the one who we could lean on.  I guess I took that for granted.  Since her death, there's been a void that cannot be filled.  It took me years to get over the urge to call her when I had good news, or bad.  The thought of never seeing her again still seems like the most absurd thing in the world.  I lost my identity when I lost her, and it has been a struggle to learn who I am without her.  I had a son in August 2012.  It breaks my heart knowing that the two most important people in  my life will never know one another.  No matter how many stories I tell him, he will never truly understand her impact on my life and how wonderful she was.  All these years later, not a day goes by that I don't think of her and miss her so much it hurts.  I wish more than anything that I could go back and tell her all these things.  My biggest regret is that she may not have known how much I loved her, and love her still.

I launched the Mandalas for Marinke project to remember her and contributions came flooding in from people who have also been impacted by depression and suicide. Here's an excerpt of what I wrote in my first post after hearing the news about her death.

""I am sitting here stunned, shocked, saddened, scared ‚Ä¶ Feeling a world‚Äôs worth of emotions that don‚Äôt have a proper place in my brain. Marinke, known to many as Wink, of A Creative Being, has succumbed to the depths of depression and taken her own life.

I first met Wink when I interviewed her for Crochet Saved My Life. She shared her story with me of living on the autism spectrum and how tough it was to make her way in the world with the social awkwardness that it caused. She shared the depression that she went through post-diagnosis, how it caused her to be hospitalized and how crochet was one of the things that helped her to heal.

I didn‚Äôt know her personally, in the real world, but I communicated with her many times over the years through various online channels. I was proud and cheered her on as I watched her world expand because of crochet. I know that the craft brought a brightness to her life despite continued dark days.

I watched as she became the first presence online to really develop and celebrate the crochet mandala. Before Wink, there were only a few of these designs available to us. She really brought that design into the forefront, publishing patterns on her site and eventually getting them placed into magazines.

It was beautiful to see this journey, her creations so filled with color and intensity and vibrancy and joy and how those designs touched so many lives and really sparked the growth of an area of our craft.

I don‚Äôt know how to describe what I am feeling today. In 2009, I was inches away from taking my own life. I have gotten ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but I believe that depression is a lifelong condition and although I‚Äôm currently in remission it could return at any time. (I recently wrote about this on Diary of a Smart Chick.)

Wink‚Äôs suicide makes me feel so many things and I have to acknowledge that one of them is fear. Fear that this could happen to anyone I know, anyone else who shared their story in my book, anyone else who I know has been through depression, anyone else like me. Wink, on the surface, seemed to be doing great. She has a loving family, a boyfriend, a huge online community that is so inspired by her ‚Ä¶ and depression still came back and it got her.

I feel like I‚Äôm doing all of the right things and yet depression always lurks just around the corner, creating this constant low level hum of anxiety in me. No matter how many books I publish, how many people I connect with online and in person, how much love I have in my life, how right I eat or how properly scheduled my life is or how balanced I keep things, depression can come back.

It‚Äôs scary. It‚Äôs sad.

When I read the news this morning, so many emotions coursed through me. I immediately reached out to talk to my mom, my dad, my beaux, my school friends. I realized in the midst of one of those conversations that what was happening was that my brain was trying to make sense of where this fits in my own life. The brain sees patterns and tries to put things into their place. And it doesn‚Äôt have a place for this. Wink was my friend but I didn‚Äôt really know her. She shared some of her deepest truths with me in our interview and yet we never met in person. She had so many similarities to me and yet she was very different from me. My brain wondered if she had received my email and if there was more that I could have done to help and then immediately chastised itself because all of my personal and academic knowledge says that this is precisely how everyone reacts and there usually isn‚Äôt anything more we could have done. It‚Äôs not about us. It‚Äôs not about me. And yet it‚Äôs deeply affecting me.

I‚Äôm sad, but not in the kind of way where I need to cry (yet?). I‚Äôm feeling so much empathy and compassion for her family and friends. I‚Äôm feeling a huge connection to my crochet community and wanting to reach out to each of you because I know that this news might affect some of you in various ways as well. I want to do something for Wink, in Wink‚Äôs honor, something related to crochet.

Back in 2013, Wink named me as one of her crochet heroes. No, Wink, you are the hero. I am so, so sorry that depression grasped you and pulled you under. I hope that in the years since your diagnosis you had more good days than bad. I hope that you realized, at least some of the time, the stunning reach that you had to inspire people across the globe with the beauty of your crafting."""

Malisa was one of my best friends in high school. We were practically inseparable. Eventually, the time came for me to go to college out of state, but we still kept in touch as often as possible. After her parents' divorce, she found herself homeless. My parents opened their doors to her and welcomed her in as one of their own- she had her own key and didn't even need to ask. If we saw her tiny shoes by the front door, we knew she was staying for a while. If I was away at college she would stay in my room, and if I was back we had an air mattress in a separate room for her. She would stay with my family for weeks at a time, and we treated her like family every time she was here. One of my favorite memories of her is when she surprised me in the kitchen of my family's home the day I came back for a school break. She was there with her boyfriend and they both were waiting for me with a bottle of cheap rose champagne to celebrate my return.

On November 6, 2011, she took her own life.

I, and everyone else, was in shock. We had known she had been depressed, but we didn't expect it. It could happen to anyone but her, right? I flew back home after my final exams as soon as possible and barely made it in time for her funeral- I deplaned, got in the car with my family, and drove fast enough to make it just in time for the memorial service to start.

The only silver lining in the loss of my best friend inspired me to take care of my own mental health issues. If I had not suffered through this, my family and friends would have suffered over me. I think of her often... thankfully the memories are now warm and inviting, instead of grim."

He was 39 years old.  Wonderful Dad and brother.  Almost nine years ago ,my brother, Len King, committed suicide. That event has profoundly affected my life. There were signs of his distress, but I didn‚Äôt see them as a problem. Before this, I did not have anyone close to me that had committed suicide. As many affected by suicide, the grief and guilt is great. Every time that I would hear about another suicide, my heart would just ache and painful memories would come flooding back.

There is a saying that at times something good comes out of something bad. From my brother‚Äôs suicide, I have been able to reach out to others affected by the same situation. At the same time, I came to the conclusion that not enough is being done to prevent the stigma of mental illness. Not enough is being done to educate people in knowing the signs of mental illness."

She leaves behind a loving husband Doug, two brothers Ron and Ken, and her sister Sharon.

At the age of eighteen, Laura enlisted in the Navy and happily served for 11 years. Laura had a wonderful career for over twenty years at Varian Medical Systems. Her many friends and colleagues there became her extended family.

Laura had a passion for many things. She loved the outdoors, mountain biking, working with gemstones to make jewelry, but most of all she loved tennis. Seeing Laura on the courts for six hours at a time was not unusual. She will be remembered for her great sense of humor, her laugh and ceaseless energy.

Laura often said that she had accomplished everything she had ever dreamed of, had everything she had ever wished for, had the best boss in the world, and the most wonderful relationship with Doug.

We will never be the same without her.

I am so sorry that my help was not enough, Those demons that sought you out just decided to give up. I can only hope that you are finally at peace, As for the rest of us left behind the sorrow will not cease.

For we shall meet again someday, with no sorrow, no pain, and that is when together, we, will slowly ride away.

A survivor of childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence throughout her life and substance abuse, She always did what she thought was best to give her kids the best chance at surviving this sometimes cruel world. She also taught us to go outside, and look at nature when we were feeling down, and to feel god's Majesty and guiding hand. She never received any treatment for the trauma she suffered, and did her best to cope in the ways she knew how. By the time she was 49, she had her first psychotic break, in which the system failed her. After being involuntarily committed numerous times, and being released from the mental health safety net because she was deemed to not pose a significant threat to herself and others, she ended up in jail where her mental illness deepened and took root. After breaking her mother's arm, she ended up in jail again, and was transferred to the state psychiatric hospital, where she was told to plead not guilty, and sent back to jail. She did not think that treatment or medication would help, and wanted to deal with it on her own. In late summer 2014, on the verge of another psychotic break, she ended her life. I will never know what she was thinking in those final moments, although shortly before the accident, she told me that God had told her not to go out, because she might have an accident. Not a day goes by that I wonder what I could have done differently, what I should have said, or done, to not let things turn out the way they did. The signs were there, I should have known. I miss her so much, and just wish the world was a kinder place, where people could get real help when they need it, before they mistrust everyone.

He was such a kind-hearted family man. He was my big brother, I looked up to him. Kenny helped me when I was down and discouraged. He taught me how to drive a stick shift. The list could go on. Like many others I would never in my lifetime and beyond believe my brother would be capable of taking his own life, it was not in his character. He was a solid rock for others. I do not view suicide as selfish or cowardly. Some people are just too distraught being in the depths of despair, and feel as if they are a failure and everyone is better off without them. Depression is a silent killer. No one should feel ashamed to reach out for help, our society has such a negative stigma when it comes to depression. We all have those days, but some have it worse than others. I just wish my brother was still here. At least I can still see his infectious smile through his sweet daughter.

Katrina was a vibrant young woman with blond curly hair, a brilliant smile, a bright future, and a passion to live.

Katrina loved school, but her success was hard earned; she had learning disabilities, dyslexia and ADD. All through college Katrina was a straight A student who based her entire identity on her academic performance. Thought to be just a ""moody teenager"", Katrina had a mental illness, anxiety and depression, which was not properly diagnosed and treated and led to her suicide. Katrina was a high achiever with a need to be perfect ‚Äì she self-medicated with alcohol and drugs. On the outside Katrina appeared to have it all together but on the inside she was an anxious mess. Katrina could help people with their problems, but she couldn't see her way through to help herself with her own problems. She hid her pain from all of us who could have helped her.

Katrina was an incredibly strong person, but what she accomplished in her life while battling depression, she had unimaginable courage. Katrina was a gifted writer, and wrote, ‚ÄúI am dying inside. Withering away and I‚Äôm too scared to share this with anyone but this computer screen‚Äù. We now know that Katrina had a mental illness, diagnosable and treatable like any other illness. Her illness skewed her views on reality making her think she was a burden and our lives would be better off without her. And as smart as she was, she was completely wrong.

Just as in life, Katrina continues to help others in death. Katrina‚Äôs family shares Katrina‚Äôs story to honor her life and memory. They want to shine a light on mental illness so those who are suffering in silence can learn from Katrina and get the help they need to live. Katrina‚Äôs family hopes that with awareness and education, the shame, silence, and stigma of mental illness and suicide can be stopped.

Katrina‚Äôs voice wasn‚Äôt heard when she was alive, but if Katrina‚Äôs story resonates with you and you are struggling to live, please seek help. The myth that talking about suicide encourages suicide is just that, a myth. Talking about suicide does prevent suicide. Understanding Katrina‚Äôs pain of living and sharing that knowledge in memory of her and others that died by suicide will save lives that would have otherwise been lost had we not had the courage to speak up. Remember, even one suicide is one too many. Every life matters, your life matters."

My grandfather died by suicide 6 months after the death of my grandmother, his wife of 47 years.  I was 16 years old at the time.  I met John 3 weeks later.  My husband, John, died by suicide 4 years after losing his job of 22 years at Motorola, 11 months prior to retirement eligibility.

The support of his family and friends could not save him.  We were married for 32 years.  Now, nearly 10 years later, I still suffer from depression due to losing the love of my life.  John was a wonderful father, and his death has greatly affected our children.  He was a Boy Scout Master, volunteer soccer coach, and very involved in our children's lives.  He was Santa Claus for our HOA Christmas gatherings. He was Godfather to our nephew, who was orphaned at age 13. He was the glue who held our family together.  Our once very close family has been, literally, destroyed. John's mother moved in with me in 2012. She had outlived 2 husbands and her only 2 children.

John had a tons of issues from bipolar to a drug addiction, but when John was sober and OK with the bipolar he was an incredible person and son. He was loving and caring with a huge heart. His passion was drawing and giving tattoos. John's style was very unique and kinda dark, but could also draw the most beautiful pieces of birds, hearts, and butterflies. John had many friends, but because of his illness he always felt alone and that no one cared about him.

Since his death me and my entire family have been devastated by grief. The what ifs, and if onlys still pop up all the time. My son left behind 2 sons who have also been impacted by his passing and struggles to make sense of it all. I don't think any of us will ever figure it all out. Suicide is not a normal death. It wasnt old age, or an accident. My son took his life by his own hand. There is nothing normal about it, and with the stigma that still surrounds suicide getting the message across to others for me is key.

John you are always missed and forever loved!

Our beautiful Mother, Sister, Daughter.  You suffered so long and you hid it so well.  None of us realized how long or how much pain you were in.  You were our first born, the light of our lives, our pride and joy.  Life will never be the same without you.

Rest my dear, your suffering is over.  Help us use your story to help others.  We are always with you and you are always with us.  Until we meet again my love."

She seemed to have big mood swings. Looking back I now realize she may have been bi-polar! She would explode one minute and turn around and want to play a game as though nothing had happened 5 minutes later.

On August 8th, 1999 she had finally gotten off being grounded. She was allowed to go to a friend‚Äôs house, but had to be home by eleven or so. When she didn't come home we worried. Finally in the early hours of the morning of the 9th of Aug. we finally sent a sheriff to where we thought she might be. He brought her home. Her father and I yelled at her, we all argued!! We said she was grounded again. We had to go to our Archery tournament and told her she could not call anyone and we would be home in a couple of hours.

We came home. I felt bad for her so I made her favorite supper. Went to her room to tell her it was time to eat! I found her on her bed!! At first I thought it was make up!! Then I realized she had ended her life and started screaming and crying for her father to come quick!! The rest of the night is such a blur. I just wanted my baby back!! The ambulance and Sheriff were called I guess. My sister and her husband were called. We were all taken to the hospital, I guess I was in shock, don't remember much. Just kept crying and saying I wanted my baby. Asked for my other daughters to be brought to me.

HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN????

So many lives changed that day. I felt so dead inside. The only thing that got me through it all was having my other daughters and Jessica's friends to console and take care of!! My husband was so strong and stood by me!!!

She had close friends that have stayed close to us to this day!!! We talk and share our memories!! That's all we have now. It has gradually become easier to bear. Sometimes it can still be rough. Birthdays, holidays, I know the people on this sight can understand what I mean and feel!!!


Missed by Avis, Joe, Catrina, Colleen, Kelly - Mother, Father, Sisters!! Friends- Christina, Heather, Kate and many others!!"

Jesse was a very happy, loving positive man.  He was the rock in our family.  When I was emotional he was the strong one.  When Jesse left us we were in complete shock.  On a Wednesday Jesse was in the ER for a panic attack and the next Sunday he was gone from us forever.  We struggle every day with his absence.  Our daughters now ages 11 and 7 keep his memory alive every time they smile and laugh.  Jesse loved music and played the guitar so we continue to enjoy music in our home and some songs make it feel like Jesse is sitting right next to us.

Jarid was a unique boy that had a beautiful heart and a knack for making others laugh.  He enjoyed hanging out with his friends, playing video games, playing basketball, listening to music, and attending his church's youth group.  Little did his family know, Jarid was fighting a huge battle at school and after school, the battle of being bullied.  He was mistreated by people at school and none of us ever knew about it.  Jarid decided to take his own life on June 8, 2003.  This affected his family more than anyone could ever imagine, unless they themselves have experienced a suicidal loss.  It has been 11 years and counting.  I (his cousin Lindsay) participate in annual suicide awareness and prevention events to ensure that the number of suicides go down in the country.  Doing these things will never bring Jarid back to us, but it will ensure that he did not die in vain.  He will continue to be remembered as the boy we once knew that brought us all the joy and love that this world has to offer.  The only thing we can do now is show that same love to others who are suffering the loss of someone they love to suicide.  So, if you have lost someone to suicide, I am deeply saddened by your loss.  It is not easy, but you can be rest assured that you are NEVER alone.

It is now my mission, with his help, to prevent other parents from going through the heartbreak I am living. His friends from high school were determined to keep me moving in a positive directions and inspired me to create a foundation in his honor dedicated to Suicide Awareness and Prevention.  We keep Jared's Keepers Foundation, Inc promoting suicide prevention and awareness targeting the pre-teen, teen, and young adult community.  It is also a place to honor those who have left us too soon. The continuous increase in the number of suicides is alarming. It is just as alarming that because of shame and embarrassment many go unreported for accurate accounting. Our active military and verterans are the fastest growing sector behind teens in suicide rates. It is our mission to stop the stigma and lay a path for those who need help to get to the resources they need.  This fall we begin work with a Tennessee Senator to mandate the AFSP's More Than Sad Program into every high school in Tennessee.  We continue to work beside the AFSP to stop the stigma and stop suicide.  This drive and determination was in my son Jared.  He excelled at his sport of soccer and has become the ""Keeper"" to all of us.  I hear him say to me to go ""fix"" this mom, just as he did throughout his life."

I know that when he chose to end that struggle, it was not about leaving us. It was about finally finding some peace. If any one of us could have taken that pain away from him, we would have. Now, we each carry a little bit of it in our broken hearts. He was so loved by so many people. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, friends...

Respected amateur seismologist, he was working with a naval historian interested in my father's WWII service when he took his life. He also worked with Project Purr after his retirement, capturing feral cats and getting them neutered and spayed. He and his wife Caroline fed all the feral cats in their neighborhood, taking some into their home. Mike struggled with alcoholism and undiagnosed major depression (diagnosed as simple dysthymia instead) for many years. An unsuccessful detox attempt and the death of his dog in the same week were the triggers of his suicide at age 59 in October 2009. He had attempted suicide a year earlier. I felt constant, intense grief and guilt for three years after his death. Finally, during the fourth year, I found that I was going a whole day without crying, and eventually a day without thoughts of the suicide. It's now been five years and I haven't reached a point where I have joy back in my life, but the difference between how I feel now and how I felt the first few years is very definite - Mike's suicide isn't the main focus of my life anymore, and when I think of it I feel sadness now instead of crippling grief. I let myself grieve without any restrictions, and it allowed me to get to this point. I still think of him almost daily, but the sadness has a bottom limit now. Just the other day, while camping, my husband and I talked about Mike. My husband said Mike's death felt to him like a huge waste, and talked about how much he had liked him. I miss him all the time.

If you called him for help he was already in his car on his way before you even had to ask! He showed no signs that he was hurting so bad inside, so our family could of helped him like he did for so many. He went through a break up with his girlfriend that hurt him more than he ever showed. He just couldn't deal with the pain he was feeling each day and it took over his mind and body! Now we have to live each day with a huge part of our hearts missing and the memories we had together! He is and always will be extremely missed and loved until we meet again!

They say it is suicide but I refuse to believe it. It hasn't been two weeks but your love for your children and for family make this an impossibility to us who love you. I am upset  but not angry, my grief is unbearable . You could have called me and I would come running. Were you depressed? Were you scared? Were you ill? Did you feel so isolated that you felt no one would help? Was mum's death September 3, 2015 too much to bear? I want you to know in the heavens that while we hurt and miss you, we understand though we don't. Obviously, my precious baby brother, you were in too much pain to live in such a cruel world. Were too many demands made of you? What did we do and if we did something, you knew you could tell us. Is there anything we should be apologizing to you for? I am just so sorry you ended up this way. No one believes it, they know you, I know you but we have to accept it until the coroner says otherwise. Guess what, everyone loves you, can you tell from where you are in the Heavens. Your death has devastated people but there is so much love for you out there. I cry every night when I think of why you might have done this. You loved your children so much that we know you would not do this to leave them to suffer yet we must face the truth. You are gone.

I shudder when I think that you were hurting inside and suffering and your smile and laughter tricked us all. Many times I don't think it was suicide at all.

I know you are safe and at peace but I want you back.

I am so hurt and grieved, I can't find words but I will talk to you soon.

I love you

Big sis, Kim"

I was nine years old when the little black haired brown eyed boy came into my life and for many years he was much a part of my life as I was apart of his. For years, some of my favorite memories of becoming a young adult was of me showing and teaching him about life, during Christmas, family holidays and other family events. Then when I was 16 I met the woman I would later marry and have our first child with. And from the moment he met her he loved her and treated her apart of my family even before i saw and treated her that way during my Jr. Year of high school. My sister decided to up and move to Florida and within weeks of him being gone from my life I missed him terribly but in my heart I always thought I would see him again. Then June 9th 2015 it was a normal day of work until when I got the call from my mom the first call I ignored and let go to voice mail because I wasn't suppose to be on my phone the second call I knew something was wrong so I answered and heard the news that he had took his life earlier that morning right after I denied it and tried to put the thought from my mind for weeks I just ignored the anger and sadness. One night My wife laying in bed with me told me I had to get it off my mind and we laughed we cried and felt better about it. I still hurt till this day and not a day goes by I don't think about him and miss him. I'm not the religious type but I find comfort in thinking I'll still see him again.. For the last part I decided to dedicate my next tattoo for him the passage ""the flow of time is always cruel"" is from legend of Zelda which was a game we played when we were growing up and to me it means something and not just for the memory part to me its we can never go back and change stuff because if I could I would I would say all the things I didn't get to but I can only move forward and I'll keep his memory and his spirit with me and that's something to be happy with.

Our first date was June 1, 2013 at Hickory Notch Restaurant in Goochland, VA.  On June 20, 2013, he proposed to me in a text message while I was in PA visiting my family.  He moved in July 1, and our journey as a couple began.  I knew as soon as I met him that he was my soul mate.  He made me laugh, he made me feel safe, he was truly Mr. Right.

As we got to know each other, he told me about his struggle with depression.  He called it the ‚Äúfamily curse‚Äù because his mother suffered with it most of his life.  He worried that his daughter would be affected with it as she grew up.  He shared that he had admitted himself to a mental treatment program two years previously when his father died unexpectedly and he considered suicide.  In November 2013, he was laid off from his job as a 511 dispatcher when the company changed hands.  While he spent a lot of time being down, he kept surviving and never gave up hope.  On February 15, 2014, we were married.  A week later he went to the doctor since I could finally add him to my health insurance.   The doctor prescribed medication, and within weeks he was improving.  He started a new job at the beginning of March.  He hated it but he endured because it was a job.

Halfway through May, his depression really took a bad turn.  Even though I asked him every day if he was okay, he never told me what was bothering him.  He started hitting the snooze in the morning, rarely shaved, had lost about 20 pounds and stopped doing anything around the house.  All of this was not him at all.  On May 24, we attended his daughter‚Äôs high school graduation.

Four days later, as I left for work, we kissed and said goodbye for the day.

We may never know the answers to all of our questions. But, out of the overwhelming sadness that I and all of us involved have endured, the Lord has pressed into our hearts a need to make a difference.

One Saturday, in February of 2013, my 6 year old daughter was taking a shower. Pressing her precious little hands into the steam on the glass wall, I reached in to help her shampoo her hair. It was then she exclaimed, ""Mom, stop! You are messing up my hope hands!"" Wanting to know what she meant, I asked her to explain. Without reservation, she began to explain to me something that sparked in me this idea. She told me that she missed Hugh so much, that he made her smile and laugh. She said we should start collecting hand prints to let Hugh know how much we love and miss him.

Out of this, I began to pray, with my husband Jarrett's encouragement, asking God to show me what to do with this idea. We began this as simply a tool to share your stories, to make a declaration that you will choose to live, to continue to press on and that private site will still exist. For the past two years, you've been asked (if you were a member of this group) to simply write the word HOPE on your hand or make a handprint with paint, snap a picture and upload it with a story or simply a pledge to choose LIFE. During this time, countless individuals have reached out to me helping me to understand just how many people feel so overwhelmed, depressed, anxious and hopeLESS.

In the wake of Hugh's choice to leave this earth too soon, it has been deeply impressed into us to carry on his legacy of sharing the love of Christ with all, especially those who are without hope. So, hands4hope, I pray will be a ministry to reach the hurting with the love of Christ through prayer, acts of service, counseling and other efforts of prevention and public awareness to mental illness, suicide & self-harm. We must break the silence of shame and seek healing in the name of Jesus Christ. We are not experts, merely servants with hearts and hands that desire to break the silence of suicide and mental illness."

While there is no bureaucratic research on suicide in public safety occupations, researchers estimate that more police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers die by suicide than in the line of duty.  The very traits that make them good at their job (compassion, duty to others, a helper mentality) put them at risk for depression and PTSD.  Barriers to seeking help include the fear of being weak, losing their job, or no longer being considered a superhero capable of doing anything.

My big brother would drop anything, anytime to help anyone.  In his years of service to the Milwaukee (WI) Fire Department, he was often seen interacting with marginal people--the innocent, the children, the elderly, the homeless--during a fire or EMS call.  He didn't want the attention of being a rescuer.  He wanted to pay attention to others.  Eventually, that big heart could no longer handle his desire to save the world.  He gave in to addiction and alcoholism as ways to fight his depression.

In the 20 years since his death, I have been vocal about depression within our family and within these often misunderstood and under appreciated occupations.  I can do nothing about Charlie's death, but I can do so much to prevent another suicide.  I trudge on conducting training and workshops for police, fire, EMS, and corrections helping them to identify the warning signs of depression and suicide in their professions.  Not an easy subject to broach, but it is breaking down barriers.

Always in his memory.  In that way, his death was not in vain, and he continues to serve his community through this work."

Beloved daughter, grand-daughter, sister, niece and friend

Hannah was a beautiful girl, loved by many with a huge heart.  She had a passion for animals, music and was an artist who enjoyed creating amazing things out of what most of us would consider garbage or useless.  She enjoyed her friendships with people of all walks of life.  Judged no one...loved everyone.  The last couple of years she struggled on and off with depression and anxiety.  She had recently ended a long term relationship with her first love.  The week before her death she had planned on getting her first tattoo with the words ""Know Your Worth"" to remind her that no matter how people make you feel about yourself or what you have been thru, you have value..  How we wish she would have held on and learned how true that was.

Our lives have been forever changed.  We think of her every moment of every day.  There is a huge hole in our hearts that will never close.  The pain of her loss is monumental and we can only pray one day it will subside.  But, we know she is in a better place..at peace and without pain."

I lost my brother to suicide on Halloween day 2007. He was a loving son, brother, and best friend! And he was loved by everyone! And still is!

He was an amazing artist and even attended the Illinois Institute of Art in Chicago. He was crazy smart, especially with computers. He even taught my 5th grade computer class.

He is survived by his parents Robert and Jessie Howell and his sisters Stephanie Howell and Kimberly Winn.

We all love and miss him so much!

Our beautiful, and beloved son, brother, and friend Evan Nathaniel Nasky, died by suicide while attending the University of Evansville, IN. Evan had recently turned 21, and was in the second semester of his junior year. Spring break was beginning and Evan was preparing to act in one production and direct another scene in the coming weeks. We had spoken by phone to Evan the Thursday before he died and planned on being there for his performance the following weekend.

Evan was a special person in so many ways. He worked hard in school, and he was always among the gifted students. He was a very intelligent, compassionate young man, but his innate ability to focus and follow through made him truly gifted. He graduated high school third in his class class with an International Baccalaureate Diploma. His finalist status in the National Merit Scholarship program brought dozens of application packets from universities from across the USA.

Evan thoroughly enjoyed his friends, whether it was select soccer, or chess, or choir, or video games he was certain to be all in and enjoying the challenge. It was in middle school that he came across one of his main passions which was acting and theater. After a middle school production of Footloose he was certain this was his future. By the end of high school he had been in every production during those four years and had won awards all along the way in regional state and national thespian competitions, including ‚ÄúBest Actor‚Äù at state one act play competition his senior year. So it was no wonder that despite all the scholarship offers from colleges across the country he chose to attend one with a reputation for a quality theater program. His full scholarship at UE and the 32 credit hours he entered college with due to his International Baccalaureate Diploma and AP testing allowed him to spend time focusing on his theater skills, taking voice lessons and developing another of his passions which was learning the violin.

Evan's gifts were not limited to his scholastic and theatrical achievements. He seemed to be at ease with life and enjoyed what he saw as the important things: his family, his friends, the natural world, classical music, classic movies, and being involved in moving forward with his passions. He never failed to see the humor in life. His wonderful sense of humor was a gift he shared with everyone.

When he made a decision he was certain of the logic for it and was committed to follow it through. His desire to improve his physical strength to do lifts in the choreography for a musical started him on a conditioning goal that continued unabated and led to P90X training and Brazilian Jujitsu among other activities. Evan always said that an actor had to be an athlete as well.

The sincerity he expressed in his own life was witnessed by many who were fortunate enough to come in contact with him and be part of his life. Even if only for a few months like those he met at summer theater programs or his semester in Perugia, Italy at the Umbra Institute. So many have reached out when they heard of Evan's loss to the disease of suicide. His death was a total shock to both family and friends. None of us saw or realized what was happening to him. He was too talented, too intelligent, too logical, too funny, too sincere and open to be suffering from a disease unknown to us all. This tragedy will haunt us forever. We talked to him two days before and we could tell his voice was different but we did not see the reality, we saw a son who was tired and in need of a spring break. No amount of pain or desire can give another chance at that phone call.

Not until we subpoenaed counseling records from the University we did we discover that Evan had been in counseling, where he had mentioned having suicidal thoughts. Evan did seek help, but the level of help available was not effective. If we had known that Evan had suicidal thoughts, we would have moved heaven and earth to help him."

Self medicating because he did not like the side effects of RX drugs. Eric was especially fond of the number 13, and proudly sported several tattoos on his strong arms and legs. A Gemini born on Sunday, he was always at war with himself. He was a lover and a gentleman. He knew how to show respect and treated people with dignity. The veil is thin. The body may be damaged and no longer here, no more hugs. But the soul - Oh the soul! The love, passion, intelligence, wit, the memories - that exists still - in the heart and memories of those who loved him, and we feel him as close as a whisper. As gentle as a breeze, in the smell of roses, and we hug & laugh in our dreams, until we too cross the horizon.

Losing him has left a hole that can never be filled. Doug was the type of person who wanted to make a difference in other‚Äôs lives, wanting to see others succeed in anything they pursued. He will be missed forever and for always."

Dolores was my mom for 12 years. I have been missing her for 40 years. I am glad that she is out of pain, she struggled with some kind of un-diagnosed depression throughout the time I knew her. It a good thing for her to be onto something else. I have been hugely effected by her life and her death. As a child I felt unduly responsible for her well being, at her death, I felt I had failed her. At every milestone I have missed her and mourned for her. I will always love her and appreciate the time I had with her. Likewise, I appreciate all the helpers (counselors, etc..) that have helped me on my path without her. Thank you.

Devin always does things on his own terms. Even as a baby (younger than 1) he would cry and hold his breath until he turned blue and passed out. He always strived to be the best that he could be, whether it was being the Straight A student, playing baseball, marching band or creating NATE (National Association of Teen Excellence) so that every kid got a chance to go to college, or just being a great son, brother and friend.

Devin,
We talked about everything. There was no subject or topic that we didn't discuss. I'm not sure why you didn't come to me. I would have told you it was a lie!! A lie that someone made up just so they could get the wrong kind of attention. All of your true friends and family would have known it was a lie, and would never have believed it. I know you shown me most of the pieces and the puzzle fits and I do understand as your mom how you thought you were doing what was best. But, I still ask why and when I do I hear you say ""Because I am Devin Morey!"" When you died a big piece of me died with you, and I know the same is true with your brother, sister, and friends. Your friends meant the world to you, and you to them. What I wouldn't do to hear you say ""Frank, why you so butt hurt? Is it cuz your food taste like Gratiot?"" Baby, you are so deeply loved and missed every day, I am so lost without you, life just is not anywhere close to being the same as it was when you were here, I love you so much."

After many surgeries and several complication over a couple of years it only bought him time. We were informed in October 2012 there wasn't anymore they could do. He was lost, in pain, mental and physically he took his own life on November 30, 2012.  Everyday is still hard. We were married blissfully for almost 21 years and it was hard to take that he gave up, after the anger, I was able to concentrate on the good memories and the good times which were many until the work Cancer came into our lives. He was a loving and caring man and his job and family meant everything to him.  We have two boys that remind me of him everyday.  We moved to Oklahoma to move forward and away from the sadness. We were both involved in the community and always volunteered our time to help others so we were well known and the community, collegues, friends and family still morn the loss of this great man. I tell my self everyday that I was VERY blessed to have had him in my life. With the help of God I know I did what the good book says when you marry and that is ... for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health til death do you part.... That is where I find my comfort and to know he will be waiting for me on the other side.  Amy

He had a sense of wit and humor that could keep us all laughing for days and years to come over the things he said and all his antics. He was one in a billion ! His troubles began when he entered puberty. We noticed his behavioral changes and it just got worse and escalated until he landed in a treatment facility. He was diagnosed with mood disorder and put on medication, but did not like taking his medication as required. He eventually appeared to be maturing and calming down. He had stopped medication all together and had begun to become a productive member of society and the family. We let our guard down and failed him. My Soul has been very damaged by his loss. Our Family has been very hurt. On December 20, 2014 Joe attempted suicide and was resuscitated, but was diagnosed with severe brain damage. After many test and procedures. On the Morning of December 23rd, the Doctors told us he was stuck and would need life sustaining machines and would probably not last long because of the severity. They then informed us to think about how Joe would want to live his remaining days, and that he was now starting to show symptoms of pneumonia. On the Morning of December 24th, His Father and I informed the Doctors that we knew he wouldn't want to live on machines, and we agreed to remove all life support - Christmas Eve 2014 Our Baby Boy passed away at 7:55 pm. I have cried, screamed, yelled, thrown things, and most of all stopped enjoying my life. It been 10 Months and I am just now starting to breath without it hurting so bad. I'm angry at the people that he told he was going to do this to, because they did nothing but leave him out in the Cold, Dark, Night, Alone and didn't stay with him or call for help. They called first responders after they found him. He cried out and no one did anything to help him. I feel it was preventable if we could have gotten him back on medication. They claim they thought he just wanted attention, and another person said ""what was I supposed to do about it"". I informed her she could have called 911 or called us or anybody. Not just leave him like that. I'm angry with God that My Son had to battle with his emotions all the time. He didn't feel normal. I'm mad at him for not calling us, then I get mad because maybe he wanted to but didn't have a way to call us. He had taken his girlfriend to El Paso to get a car from her Dad and so he was very far from home. He was already down because he had just lost his job because of his girlfriend‚Äôs sister. Any ways, I'm feel very Angry, Hurt, Devastated, Lonely, Sick, Broken to the Core of my Soul ! I stay like this about 60% of the time now, it was 100% of the time before.  I just wish I could go back in time and be more attentive of his needs. He left behind 3 small children, (2 his and 1 stepdaughter that he had been raising since she was 2 months old). His Son was 3 months old when he left. I'm angry when I see all the guys doing things with their children and he is not here to be with his because he loved his children dearly and was a fantastic father for being so young. He was the main care provider for his baby son.  He will forever be 18 and I will be broken until I see him in Heaven."

Allerding, DVM, was an incredibly talented and compassionate man, especially when it came to animals.  He could heal the sick no matter their size, shape, or skin covering (be it scales, fur, hair, or feathers) and was always eager to learn how to treat animals that he'd never treated before (he onced learned how to perform surgery on a fish).  He was also very passionate about saving lives, and would perform surgery on an animal for free if it saved them from being put to sleep.  He refused to euthanize an animal unless it was truly suffering.

When he wasn't being a veterinarian, he was creating art. Oil paintings, beautiful gardens, and most impressively, wood working. My father created some of the most beautiful hand carved wooden furniture I've ever seen- and it was built to last.  He also had quite the sense of humor. His comedic idol was Pee-Wee Herman and I can't remember a day in my entire life with him where I didn't hear him quoting Pee-Wee, or at the very least, doing the Pee-Wee Herman dance.

On the surface, it seemed like there was nothing my father couldn't do... but there was one thing; he couldn't find happiness.  After he took early retirement, he lost his sense of purpose. He only left the house to treat large animals across the state, play tennis or golf (begrudingly), work in his woodworking shop (a few feet from the house), go to church (in search of purpose), to canvas the neighborhood with petitions he felt strongly about (which caused him great anxiety) or visit his 2 children and his grandson (and even some days, that was a struggle).  After a while, he realized he needed help and he reached out to his doctor and was put on medication.  Neither he nor his wife truly understood the risk of suicidal thoughts being a potential side effect, and my father continued to be reserved while his wife went on thinking things were status quo and not checking in.

Within a month after he started medication, we all decided to celebrate my Dad's 58th birthday by going out to dinner and attending a John Prine concert. My Dad and his wife were almost an hour late because he was anxious about leaving the house, and he seemed more upset than usual that he had missed seeing my son (his grandson) who was off being babysat for the evening. He was notably somber and much more highly complimentary of me than usual as well. At then end of the night we said our goodbyes and while I felt like something was off, I couldn't put my finger on it. Then the next morning, just before noon, I got the call.  My father had committed suicide, that morning.

I feel like this video showcases his wacky sense of humor, and it was filmed at a time in his life where he seemed the most comfortable with himself and potentially the most content.  This is how I like to remember my Dad, taking time to not be serious and add a little laughter into the world, spending quality time with my brother and I, and not crippled by his mental illness.  He was an incredible person who spent a lot of his life struggling to live his life day to day, and he messed up as a parent, a LOT, but his life and his death have helped me tremendously in my role as a mother of a child with mental illness and because of that, my child has a really good chance to live a longer healthier happier life."

It was such a wonderful time,
Roy Rogers on the TV,
Washed clothing on the line.

Having a catch in the front yard,
Walking along the creek,
Suppertime at four o'clock,
at night, a kiss, placed gently on my cheek.

Then high school graduation,
Off to college, I go,
Four years later life was good, I thought,
but . . .
What did I know?
-----------------------------------------------
'Cause it didn't last forever,
Good times seldom ever do,
Life altered in the middle of the night,
When despair was all he knew.

For on that night long ago,
a final decision was made,
By himself and all alone,
No one there to offer aid.

Growing up yet was I,
Though nearly twenty-four,
Still much to learn and realize,
When he quietly closed the door.
-----------------------------------------------
Many years have long since passed,
Still it pains me to know,
That what I can not do today,
I could have done long ago.

And so I wait and wait and wait,
as the years slowly pass me by,
Older and with aching heart,
It helps sometimes to cry.

For it makes me feel human,
and it gets me through the day,
Though I can not help but wonder,
When will peace come my way?
-----------------------------------------------
I plant flowers in the Spring,
Mums and Asters in the Fall,
It's my way of showing love,
While they rest there, one and all.

Grand Father whom I never knew,
Grand Mother and her baby,
Uncle John who fought in World War II,
Aunts Helen, Jay, and Mary.

But especially Mom and Dad,
My plantings are for them,
Always in my heart and mind,
Not just now and then.
-----------------------------------------------
And when my days come to an end,
Together again, is what I pray,
Dining at the table,
Though it's not for me to say.

For judgement will be made,
That is the Heavenly way,
'Til then on Earth I patiently wait,
Waiting for Reunion Day.

With Love,

Ron"

He had struggled with depression for several years, though I did not how bad it was until the day he decided he had had enough and ended his life. It was an horrific experience. It has been over a year now and I still cry every day. My heart is broken. I never thought I would have to experience anything like this in my life.  It was a long time before I was able to close my eyes and not see the images I had experienced. I wondered what I could have done for a long time and felt guilty that I could have not prevented it. Thanks to good treatments I am at peace with the images now, but still have the ache in my heart every day. I am getting there, but wonder if there will ever be an acceptance.

Cameron was an amazing young man who touched many lives in spite of his own secret struggles with depression. He hid his pain well. Anyone who knew him would never know he carried this pain. He ALWAYS had a smile on his face. He seemed to always be happy and tried to make others happy. He would be the first person to help if you were in trouble never asking for anything in return.

In 2012, July the 5th, I lost my brother to suicide. Handsome boy that will stay forever young. He was 21. Where to start, a few months prior. Just had himself a newborn baby boy, the first in our family to pass on our name. Everything was wonderful. Smiles all around. Then one day his girlfriend at the time decides to break off the relationship, take away his right to see and hold his child. The world caved in on him. Troubles with the law, sobering up, doing everything the right way...like we intend. The day we lost my brother we found out he had spoken with his lawyer, and was facing jail time. I believe that to a young man that's the scariest thing of all, to feel like his life was over before it began. He always said there are no second chances once your in the system, system of the law that is. Harder to find jobs, more difficult to regain custody of his boy. And we didn't see it coming. No mood changes, no change of appearance. Just a smile. And it was over. The day I got the phone call, well, life has never been the same. We attended an Out of the Darkness walk soon after. Got all the information we needed. Yet here is the kicker.

One brochure in particular still haunts me to this day. It read something like this, ""After losing a loved one to suicide, is it more likely to happen again?""....the answer was yes, people see it as a door that was always closed, but now open. May 18th, 2013...I lost my sister. The pain of it all, also diagnosed with Lupis, the family had another hurdle to jump, another battle yet to be won. There is more to her story, like the fact she had a 20 year old daughter, and a 12 year old son. I believe that with my sister, unlike my brother, I had seen the signs of depression...of severe sadness. And with my own emotional state of mind, ended up doing NOTHING! I suggest if you see the signs, it doesn't hurt to ask how they are feeling. And it's 100% okay to talk about it. When you weigh out the pros and cons of asking about suicide, know that the pros always win. Please help where you can, and I hope this helps."

And I'm sure when I say I never seen this coming, it is a statement heard all to well. In April of 2006 we laid her father to rest. He struggled with addiction and was in and out of her life. At the age of 27 he was tired of his struggles and took his own life. I always seen the hurt in my Bri's eyes over the death of her father. At time I think she just wanted that chance to be with him to know and remember how it was when he was alive. Over the years I believed my daughter found peace with her father's death. She was a high honor student at her high school. Always one to reach out to others and find the goodness in someone else. She had many friends from various backgrounds. And was known for her beautiful dimples. Although, she never shared her pain inside she was looking for someone to reach out to her. She struggled with the thoughts in her mind and didn't fully understand them. After 8 year of missing her father she choose to join him. Not leaving a note or any indication on what or why she did what she did, I can only assume from the letters to her father I found that she had been writing for years. As a mother how could I not see her pain? Her struggles? Her fears? I have learned too late that it is not always the child that is dark, struggles in school, or you can see death in their eyes. Instead I learned that it was my daughter, yes my 15 year old smart beautiful daughter, that decided to commit suicide. I'm left here with the guilt, failure as a mother, and the pain that has to many emotions to try to explain. It will be a long road one of no new memories but trying to hold on to the past. You always say it can't happen to me or my child would never feel like that. We had that mother daughter bond and she didn't want to turn to me and hurt me. But I'll be broken for the rest of my life. But I choose to share her story reach out to the children and parents to let the awareness of suicide be known.

I miss you baby girl not a day goes by that I don't think about you and your father. You both left without warning and are forever carried in my heart. Love you both to heaven and back."

Mother of Richard Tatem?‚Äù And I knew that Brennan was gone.  It was at that very second that my life would change forever.  I knew that my son had been struggling with depression, but I trusted that care by a local psychiatrist would be a band aid until I could make the trip to Malibu.  I was wrong.

Of course, I didn‚Äôt know the depth of his pain, his paralyzing fear of failure, or about the fact that he had been self-medicating in addition to his prescribed medication.  I hate that I didn‚Äôt know.

It has been a year, and I remain, a mother in pain; grasping to comprehend the thought that he is really gone.  They say that time heals all wounds, but for me, I am not so sure.

Like most survivors of suicide, I am filled with doubts and questions.  Could I have done more?  Were there signs that I missed?  Sometimes the presence of his absence is overwhelming.

And yet, despite the fact that my world stopped spinning that day, life in general moves on.  And I am forced to face the question, ‚Äúnow what?‚Äù

The answer to that lies in this open letter to you, the Students of Pepperdine.  Consider it the letter I could have sent to Brennan.  Consider it the letter that your own parent would send to you.  Read it.  Reflect.  And please help me honor Brennan with your response.  And so I write‚Ä¶





Dear Students of Pepperdine.

First and foremost, I want you to know that God loves you.  He loves you with a depth and breadth that you can‚Äôt even fathom.  How do I know?   Simple.  He is a parent.  I know how much I loved my child and would do anything to have protected him from harm.

You are beloved. You are worthy of love. Never forget that.

It is by God alone that I have survived the past year.  In the depths of my despair, He has quietly sat and wept with me.  And by His grace he has allowed happy memories to surface, which felt like oxygen as I was drowning in sorrow.

Second, students I pose a question.  ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù   Are you okay?  Are you feeling overwhelmed?   Do you feel yourself pulled to darkness over light?  Does sadness feel so familiar that you are numb?  If so, I beg you to reach out.  Do not self medicate.  It may seem harmless, but you cannot predict how your body and your mind might respond.  Call home.  Talk to your parents about being homesick.  Seek out a counselor.  Let them help you redefine success.  Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help.  Remember the first thing that I told you?  You are beloved.  You are worthy of love.  You deserve happiness.

Third, students, I challenge you. I challenge you to Step Up.  Oftentimes those who are in the most pain are unable to reach out for themselves. It is up to the rest of us to take action.  Do you see someone who seems distant and distracted? Someone who has lost weight or interest in activities? Talk to them or a trusted advisor. Trust me; the hardest thing in life is to stand before a coffin wishing you had done more.

Lastly students, I want to thank you. Thank you for your kind notes of remembrance and your letters of support. Thank you for sharing your own stories of depression.  Thank you for being brave enough to ask for help. By reaching out to me, you have become my family.

I am praying for each and every one of you.

Blessings,

Donna Besler Tatem
Proud Mother of Richard ‚ÄúBrennan‚Äù Tatem"

Brandon was a beautiful young man that struggled with depression most of his young life. He was a son, brother, father and grandson. His good days were great and that's what we will remember.  We are working hard to get rid of the stigma associated with mental illness so those that need help won't hesitate to ask.

The following passage was given to us by some very dear friends from ‚Äúthe Healing of Sorrow,‚Äù by Norman Vincent Peale:

‚ÄúOur friend died on his own battlefield. He was killed in action fighting a civil was. He fought against adversaries that were as real to him as his casket is to us. They were powerful adversaries. They took toll of his energies and endurance. They exhausted the last vestiges of his courage and strength. At last these adversaries overwhelmed him. And it appeared that he lost the war. But did he? I see a host of victories that he has won!

For one thing ‚Äì he has won our admiration ‚Äì because even if he lost the war, we give him credit for bravery on the battlefield. And we credit for the courage and pride and hope that he used as his weapons as long as he could. We shall remember him not for his death, but for the daily victories gained through his kindness and thoughtfulness, through his love for family and friends, for animals and books and music, for all things beautiful, lovely and honorable. We shall remember that he was victorious over overwhelming odds. We shall remember not the years we thought he had left, but the intensity with which he lived the years he had!

Only God knows what this child of His suffered in the silent skirmishes that took place in his soul. But our consolation is that God does know and understands!‚Äù

Much to our surprise, he documented his last few weeks in a journal sharing with us that he was so depressed, sad and knew no other way out. While Brandon was a very stubborn child & young adult, more so he was thoughtful, polite, great conversationalist, humorous, athletic, appreciative, friend to all, adventurous light of our family. He had so much to offer the world and I always knew he would succeed in life; he loved challenges & competition, especially excelling in baseball and football. He had shared with me his hopes of having a family & owning a home in the middle of the woods in Maine someday. We never saw the end coming. Instructions for this online quilt is to write about your loved one and how their death affected you....While I have now come to peace with his decision, I like all other friends and family have so much guilt and ""what ifs"". My ""what if"" is the biggest regret of my life. You see, i shared the same disease as Brandon & I wish I had shared that I knew exactly how he felt, I contemplated the same things he had and struggled with the illness a good part of my life.... But its a private thing for most of us as it was for Brandon. What I wish I had shared with Brandon is that I am a success story living a very happy adult life - something I never would have guessed at the age of 19 myself. Trust me when I say it's not something you want to tell people - that you have an mental illness- but now I wish I had told Brandon. All of us have a little hole in our hearts- we go on but we all look at each other, friends and family knowing we all have that same hole. It's the hardest thing all or most of us have ever been through. It was hard to go on but as we go on I think most of us would agree that we think less about the ""suicide"" and have come to embrace our memories. He was a special connecting piece to our family.

Angela has the most amazing smile, she loved helping others. My daughter was a true example of selflessness. She loved animals and had many. I have found for me helping others and sharing Angela's story helps bring me a peace in the healing process. I find dimes and know they for me are a gentle reminder Angela is near. Also seeing cardinals. The morning Angela was born the nurse kicked everyone out of the room and opened the window to let in  beautiful spring day before she left the room.

A lovable, gracious gift of God; you came into our lives.
Brightened our days and our hearts with your grace and sweetness.

A bundle of talent and skills and charm.
Honest, pure, intelligent and giving.

You approached life with an adventurous spirit and saw each challenge with eyes of opportunity.

You gave of yourself to all who knew you and took only love in return.

If love could have held you here, you‚Äôd surely be with us today.

But ------- one day,
			you became ill‚Ä¶

It was an illness we couldn‚Äôt see and were unsuccessful in stopping.
It tore you out of our lives and left our futures less bright, less filled, less anticipated.

We‚Äôre so sorry that humanity failed you.

We know that your love and spirit live on in peace.

‚Äú‚Ä¶there are those that stop us with their honest beauty‚Ä¶like the sunflower, whose golden brilliance promises so much.‚Äù

It is fitting that the sunflower is your memorial.  Your memory will always be an honest beauty in our hearts.

We miss your earthly presence, Amanda.  We miss your smiles and your hugs.

We cling to the love that you left behind and we forgive the disease that stole you away from our arms."

1332817;Abby Louks;Mother: Judy Louks. Sister: Leesa Louks. Nephew (and author): Drake Louks;example@example.com;1331459;https://www.datocms-assets.com/14197/1565780821-abby-louks.jpg;"The picture above is a healthy version of Abby, my biological aunt. Abby had been a large part of my life from the day I was born.  I remember sitting on her lap, driving her Ford Bronco on dirt roads at a very young age. I was an amazing lap driver-- I could even multitask while driving, as I remember we often sang Crocodile Rock by Elton Jon.

Abby fell into a small stage of depression-- somewhere most of us have been. After going to the doctor, it seemed like she had a doctor who would rather medicate than listen. One diagnosis after another, prescriptions after prescriptions, the doctor was convincing Abby that she needed to cure a disease she did not have, in my opinion. Abby was given medications that, to be blunt, caused her to act like a drunken college student. If she ran out of her medications I could always tell when she ran out of her medications, because the nice, smart, and caring Abby returned-- like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

At my college graduation, Abby was acting like a drunken college kid but was still coherent. Fast-forward two weeks and Abby, yes we are still talking about the one who was smart enough to earn her nursing degree, had been diagnosed ""severely mentally ill"". The next time I saw her she had a childrens puzzle out on the table, struggling to put it together. In a fit of rage towards her doctors, I lashed out at Abby and told her ""Quit the bullsh**. You have a nursing degree, you were just fine two weeks ago. Stop letting these doctors get in your brain with their negative psychology"".  Could I have went about this better? Much. However, my attempts to get her doctors to listen were unsuccessful, and I had no clue what else to do.

In a Ted Talk by Psychologist Shawn Achor, he talks about the importance of how your brain perceives life-- is it negative, or positive? Mr. Achor goes to tell a story about speaking to a school that had a ""wellness week"" planned. He tells the school administration ""I'd be happy to speak at your school, but that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.You've outlined all the negative things that can happen, but not talked about the positive."" I truly believe Abby's doctors had the same mindset as the school administration, and let me emphasize that is MY personal opinion. 

On September 13th, 2015, Abby took her own life under the influence of her medications. I will never forget the call I received from my grandmother on that day. Her crying and pain were so intense I could barely understand what she was saying, but I was able to gather that Abby was gone. I cannot describe all of the emotions going through me-- the strongest emotion was anger, by far.

Anger that Abby's doctors ignored my many pleas to help her without medication. Anger that all of my family tried so hard to help, but were always countered by the doctors. Anger that I know Abby would never do this under her natural state-of-mind. Mostly, anger that Abby had reached out to ""medical professionals"" for help, and in my opinion, those ""medical professionals"" are the reason I will never see my aunt again.

The outpour of support for my family was amazing. My prior co-workers, know to me as my brothers in blue, were always by my family's. Chaplins, Officers, and even Kevin Treadway, the Cheif of Police, checked to see if we needed anything-- multiple times. It was amazing to see my blue family helping my blood family and how tight knit the Flagstaff community is. Regardless of my adopted Kristen always being booked weeks out, she was right there by my side to help support my family with the loss of Abby. After everything had settled for the day, Kristen gave me a gift that she knew I had wanted for almost a year now.

My favorite picture: Carl- Everyone loves Carl, but Abby treated Carl like her child. When I traveled to Flagstaff for work, I would take the extra time to bring him with me-- just for her. The Peaks- Abby had a strong love for the peaks that stand behind us in this picture. I never understood why she loved them so much, but she did. A Friend- Kristen gifted this to me knowing how much I loved this picture. I've never told her why I liked this picture so much, but she was simply able to tell I had a bond with it. There was not a lot that could make me smile during such a difficult time, but Kristen is a true friend that knew exactly what to do.

It was been six months since I lost my daughter and not a day has passed without tears. My heart hurts from the sadness. I loved her so much.

Abby was 15 years old when she died by suicide on April 17th 2015.

She loved school and was a great student. She had received so many awards in her years at Mentor College and Silverthorn. She had a passion for art and spent many Saturdays working on her portfolio at the AGO in Toronto. Abby was a good swimmer and trained with the Etobicoke Swim Team. She had so many friends...between school, swim team and camp. She loved watching movies, eating popcorn, going out for dinner and hanging out with our dogs. Her best friend Halle would sleep over at our house a lot. Abby was very close to her little brother Noah. Abby loved her summer camp - Camp Tanamakoon. I have so many great memories with Abby...she was kind and beautiful inside and out.

Over the past year Abby had developed some OCD symptoms. We found a psychologist that specialized in young people. She saw him once a week for five weeks. She saw him the day before she died.

We had no idea that Abby was considering suicide. We talked about many things but never once did the topic come up. She left us note and she was ashamed of her OCD and felt that it was better to die than to have people know about her illness.

Ending the stigma of mental illness is so important. I hope that by sharing what has happened to Abby and my family I can prevent this from happening to others. Here is the page we set up in Abby's memory: www.facebook.com/BlueForAbby"

Donnie was the most intelligent, funny, and handsome guy I'd ever met. He was everybody's friend, chivalrous and charming...and the life of the party. If he could make you laugh, he considered himself a success. His humor was witty and smart, and one of my favorite things about him.

Donnie joined the Army at 17, and was extremely proud of his service to the country he loved so much. After serving in Iraq, he returned home and eventually pursued a career in the motorcycle industry, his first passion. He developed a very successful career as a Harley Davidson technician, and became one of the best in the Houston area. He was always quick to say that he was blessed to make a living doing what he loved.

Despite his career accomplishments, the unseen wounds that war inflicted upon his heart and mind took their toll, and for more than two decades, Donnie struggled with depression, PTSD, and addiction. Only those closest to him realized just how fiercely this battle raged within. It is a helpless feeling to watch someone you love so deeply, who is so charismatic, with so much to offer, being consumed by such a beast. As sad as I am that he felt the only reprieve he would experience from it was death, I am also finding peace in the fact that his struggle with that beast is now over, and his soul has found peace.

Today, I am working toward helping other Veterans, and their wives, learn about PTSD and find resources to assist them with living through it successfully. In the early years of our relationship, I didn't have the knowledge or resources to deal with Donnie's PTSD and addictions in a productive way...and really, the resources to help me learn were scarce. Thankfully, as more awareness is developing, this is changing.

I believe there is purpose for what I lived through with Donnie, and for all I've learned from it. Helping others going through what we did is now my passion. I know he'd be proud of me for that."

Travis is my Son, my Darling Son. Travis was diagnosed with extreme bipolar depression at an early age. Bipolar is a mental illness and statistics show that 25% of people diagnosed with Bipolar disorder will complete suicide. Travis completed suicide 8/1/2013 via shotgun, at 33 years of age. Travis was a very unhappy child most of his life and has left me with a broken heart that will never mend. He and his family lived next door to me and we were very close to each other, as he did require some help, so I was always there for him. Travis was an outdoors kind of guy. Always building a campfire and sleeping in the tent with the kids. Travis and I would stay up late talking around the campfire and laughing until all hours of the morning. He always loved it up to the Thousand Islands also. He left a real void in my life, I miss him so very much. I have his three children with me at this time and enjoy them very much.

In the end God was the only one who could help her. Grief does not go away, we only learn ways to cope. She took a piece of me with her that day. I will never be the same.  Until we meet in heaven."

On June 14, 2014 my best friend Jared died by suicide. He left me at a loss for words and no closure or goodbye. Being his best friend, I decided that I didn't want to see anyone else lose their best friend, especially the way I did, so I started the Jared's Keepers Foundation and am the Director of Student Outreach for our foundation. The most important lesson I have learned is that even though I have plenty of times where I feel alone, I am not. I am stronger than I could've ever thought possible. Jared has made a major impact on my life and has made his mark in my world. I will forever be grateful for the lessons he taught me, the kindness he shared with me and many others, his love for me, and his many other wonderful aspects that made up him, Jared Michael Martin.

I hope Heaven is treating you well, my keeper. I love you.

Taylor was a funny. He was always there for others. He was talented artist. He liked to dress nice. He loved music, video games, time at home with his best friends, and endlessly talking on the phone. He loved his family. He loved Domino's Pizza and Mom's homemade spaghetti. He hated homework, the smell of artichokes, and people who are mean to others. He was just like many of your children. He was loved and he is missed.

Mitchell John Tulgetske was an amazing son, brother, uncle and friend. His heart was huge and his smile contagious. He was an artist and left behind graphic images of his struggle with paranoid schizophrenia. Most of the time he was smart, funny, caring and creative. Other times his demons would visit and he became sad, scared, lonely and withdrawn. When my mother passed away on March 2, 2014 it was all too much for him to take. He took his own life one week to the day after her funeral. Not one day has gone by since his death that I do not think of him. I miss him always."

Upon returning from the war, I went to the computer to Facebook her, only to have her obituary pop up. I was devastated and in shock.

Samuel was loved by many. Anyone who had the privilege of meeting him, instantly liked him. He was the most amazing father I have ever seen. The bond Samuel & his Daughter had was like no other, they were inseparable.

After I found my brother dead in his room I struggled a long time to be able to cope with it. It's been over 4 years since his loss & I am just now starting to feel like myself again. In the beginning I thought about attempting suicide myself but I was pregnant with my 1st child & couldn't imagine taking her life too. I went through all the emotions, anger, guilt, sadness etc. I still have these emotions every so often, I have just learned to handle them better.

My brother Jack was 18 years old when he took his life in September of 2009. He was the greatest person and an amazing younger brother with a contagious smile, a wonderful sense of humor, and one laugh after the other - he was always joking, smiling, and laughing. Jack loved to play the drums fast and hard, drive his Mustang even faster, hang out with his group of friends, and work hard at both jobs. He had a good sense of family and I have many fond memories with him. I'll never know why he chose suicide, and he never seemed depressed or burdened in any way. Jack was the epitome of happy and fun. But I know that looks can be deceiving... and smiles can be fake. I wish he would have reached out to me. I would have helped and understood, as I struggle with depression and suicidal ideation myself. But he did not reach out, and now I am trying to keep going, as it's what he would want. I am very dedicated to suicide awareness and prevention and have participated in four AFSP suicide prevention walks both in Maryland and California in honor of him, raising close to $4,000 thus far and will continue to do so at every opportunity. His memory will live on...I love you, Jack."

Christina was one of my best friends in high school. There was rarely a day where we weren't side by side, going to practice, or eating junk food on my couch. I went away to college, and Christina being two years younger stayed home in NJ.

Over the next four years our friendship was a blur. Skyping each other weekly, to talking around holidays, eventually subsided to the annual birthday text and random run ins at the bar. Her general stature and appearance always stood upbeat and happy, but reality obviously cast a much darker shadow on the inside.

It wasn't until her funeral that I realized my impact on her life; seeing old teammates, coaches, and her family, reminded me that I was as much a role model for her as she was to me.
But the months following her death have been some of the hardest. Guilt is a major feeling as of now. I feel like I let her down in many ways. Like maybe if I reached out more over the last few months things would be different. Who knows really. But I do know I loved Christina like my own sister. She will never be forgotten and I will forever be grateful for meeting and be-friending one of the greatest people I've know."

My grandmother suffered from depression following a heart attack and diagnosis of C.O.P.D.  After being hospitalized three times for attempts, I tried to get help for my Granny. But she was suffering from dementia and was allowed to make her own healthcare decisions, which included a DNR  order and invoking her HIPPA rights to include her entire family. I will never understand how her healthcare providers could watch her make 3-5 attempts over a 3 year period, but never hospitalize her, even when she had her stomach pumped of 70 various pills! And then to allow her to continue to make attempts and not allow the family any say in her care, allowing her a final and successful attempt.

I worked as a health insurance claims adjuster and completely agree with HIPPA and patient rights, but where does common sense come in with mentally ill patients who want to harm themselves? I try not to have any guilt, knowing I had no say in my grandmother's choice to take her own life, but I feel I should have stood up to the doctors and made them more accountable for releasing her so quickly after each attempt and not taking the matter more seriously.

My heart and prayers go out to all who have lost a loved one to suicide. It's hard enough losing a loved one to illness or accident. May God's love comfort and heal us all and give grace to our lost loved ones."

In May of 2009 I lost my best friend Brian Martin. Not a day goes by that I don't think about him. Brian was an amazing person that would light up a room just by walking in and giving that little grin of his . He loved making people laugh and I think that's why when I met him that September day in 1987 on our first day of Kindergarten, he instantly became my best friend and partner in crime. The stories, memories and laughter are endless when it comes to Brian. Although he was taken from us to soon, I feel honored and blessed to have been lucky enough to have Brian in my life for 22 years.

Ever since her and I were in our early teens we were diagnosed with depression and taking antidepressants. Joey had difficult bumps in the road but was able to get back to a normal for her. Every now and then as a family we would hear from her via phone calls a couple times a week and then it would go to months and no response at all then cycle all over again she assured she was taking her medications and seeing a psychologist and as well taking Adderall for ADHD. if we ever pressed our concerns with her absent calls or absent scheduled visits she would block family and friends out and get upset.every now and then she would come back on the grid like nothing ever happened, she struggled with her sexuality and finding who she was in a larger city, ""we were born in a small town in Mayville NorthDakota"". She was a wonderful young beautiful woman with a beautiful smile but the greatest was her laugh!!! You could hear that laugh miles away!it was contagious as our friends and family would say and you couldn't help but laugh with her, she loved her movies and quoting from movies with her friends, she loved cheese! She had a huge heart for older adults working as a certified nurse assistant for at least 8 years or more, she knew everyone in town and they knew her young an old. She was easy to talk to and quick to brighten your day when you were having a crappie one. Family was super important to her and when my dad found out he had lung cancer caused by pulmonary fibrosis she was torn. I don't think she ever felt dad would overcome his cancer even no matter how many times you told her that we would fight on for dad no matter what and overcome this! We had our last Christmas together in 2012 which in our minds we prayed dad would have many more to follow. It was a pretty somber Christmas but joyous at the same time we were all together again! My sister died by suicide January 9th Wednesday 2013 to carbon monoxide at our family auction building with 3 vehicles running, she had her beloved big ten S 10 and Buick running, she wore her favorite tennis shoes and my father's bandanna and had all of her belongings around her unloaded from Chicago in the building with her suits lined up neatly in a row on hangers, some pieces of jewelry and belongings she had taken from my dad and mom and sister, (she kept everything since we were young) she had been drinking and smoking weed and had her old journals from high school lined up on a recliner, in my dad's office in the building she had a catalog opened to show urns. She had written small paragraphs for each of us but was kind of scrambled and still unsure what she ment to say to us, she said she was Torn and Worn! That will for ever be engraved in my mind that she indeed was suffering from her own battles of life and my father's illness to what I believe they say one last straw must of broke the camels back. She also had a partner but to us in North Dakota there was no partner anymore and they were only roommates but to her partner they were a couple, for some reason she felt we would never except her being gay, but we tried to tell her it didn't matter we loved and excepted her and needed to take it in our own time we loved her no matter what! She kept her private life hidden from us. When we met her partner for the funeral she had told us a complete different story and that she had tried this before and that she was drinking more and doing weed in Chicago, Her partner did call us 3 days prior to tell us that she took all her things from Chicago and hadn't talked to her which seemed odd, we had a discussion and mom and my older sister were going to confront her the next day (if I remember right) but it was to late and the night before my older sister tried to get her to go have a beer and talk or drive around and talk but she said no and when my sister dropped her off she went inside shortly then walked up town to the auction building. I'm incredibly saddened that she could feel OK enough to let us in and share her life with us no matter who she was with. I wish I could of helped my twin sister. I should of felt her pain and seen her that night, I hear that wouldn't of changed her mind any but I wish I would of had one more day with her, I wish I would of known her struggles of pain, and no more will it be OK to let people say "" it was an easy way out"" or "" selfish"" my poor sister was not selfish!!!!! She was in pain and agony. I will try and honor her as much as possible, little by little I wear her clothing, keep her ashes by me, display her pictures, go to meetings, survivor walks and survivor day events and I will try to volunteer in her honor and educate about the stigma of suicide. I will continue in her name for her my dad family and friends she will always live on! Oh lay lay, she would say. Golden girls was her favorite show of all time and we played the theme song at the funeral. We laughed and cried, she was such a wonderful friend and sister and daughter! Stay golden!"

1332719;Jordan Nicole Costello;Love, Mom, Dad, Jason and Joe;example@example.com;1331459;https://www.datocms-assets.com/14197/1565780671-54712e51a11fb-500x500c.png;"My immediate family includes my husband, Vince, my 24-year old twin sons Jason and Joe and my daughter Jordan who passed away at the age of 18.

To tell my personal story of loss to suicide, I need to start with my daughter, Jordan, being born on January 17, 1994 weighing 9 pounds, 9 ounces. She was a big baby and had to be in order to hold her huge heart. She only ended up being 100 pounds and 5 feet tall, but was pound for pound the toughest girl I have ever known. She also had a heart of gold. She was always there for her family and her friends. She would drop everything to help out anyone.

Jordan fell in love early in life at the tender age of 15. It was her first and only love. Their relationship was on again/off again, but lasted 3-years while they were both in high school. She had finally ended the relationship in June of 2012. I knew this was a tough decision for her and I remember when I had gone through my breakup.

At this same time, she had also been suffering from hives and was going to need another surgery on her foot. She had undergone 5 surgeries already for various reasons.

She graduated high school and was trying to move on. She had a great summer with all of her friends, but then college started and everyone went off to start anew. Jordan had decided to stay home and go to the University of Wisconsin-River Falls for the first few years. She wanted to eventually be a nurse so that she could make sure patients were treated with kindness because she understood what it was like to be a patient.

I was unaware that Jordan was deeply depressed, even though we were extremely close. I knew she was sad and we had talked about how she needed to put herself back out there and make friends at college and begin dating again. She was doing all these things just like we talked about. But, Jordan‚Äôs depression was much deeper than I realized. I believe she visited that darkness too many times and went into a tunnel she couldn‚Äôt see her way out of.

We shared some texts a week before she died as I had been out of town. She texted me letting me know that she was not in a happy part of her life right now and she was struggling. She said ""but you are really my best friend. You are always helpful to me and so sweet. You always know what to say or do. I love talking to you and knowing I can tell you anything. I would feel so alone without you. So if I‚Äôm ever in a bad mood or mean towards you, I‚Äôm sorry. I just really want to be happy again. I just don‚Äôt want you to ever think I don‚Äôt appreciate you because I think you are not only the most amazing mom, but woman as well. You‚Äôre my biggest inspiration and I‚Äôm so blessed to have you. I love you with all my heart mom and I don‚Äôt know what I would do without you."" I replied with ‚ÄúI know you are struggling. I wish I could make it all go away. I love you and I‚Äôm praying for you. It is very tough to go through this pain. It is part of life and everyone goes through it at some point. You will meet someone who is worthy of all that you have to give. I‚Äôm always here for you. I hurt with you and love you more than I can express.‚Äù

I was also unaware of the statistics of suicide and that it can impact anyone‚Ä¶even a family full of love. I wish I would have understood the effects of depression and how suicide can play into that. If I could go back and know what I know now, I would ask her directly if she was thinking of hurting herself. I think if I had asked her that question, she would still be here today. I would also be more open with Jordan about life struggles and my experiences. I protected her from as much as I could, but maybe if I had shared more openly, she would understand that life is full of ups and downs. That we go through peaks and valley. That we learn and grow from those experiences.

My daughter ended her life on September 17, 2012 in her bedroom. I am the one that found her. I screamed and my sons came up to see what was wrong. I‚Äôm so sorry they had to witness such a horrific scene. After that, it was all just a big blur. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was real.

My family had to plan a funeral. I always thought we would be planning her wedding. I will never have grandkids from her. I will never celebrate another Mother‚Äôs Day with her. I remember bringing her home from O‚ÄôConnell Funeral Home. We had cremated her and I said to my husband, I can‚Äôt believe we are bringing her home in a box.

I will forever be changed. A piece of me is missing.

She left 8 notes which is not usually the case. While the notes are comforting, they don‚Äôt answer the question why Jordan chose a permanent solution to what was likely a temporary problem.

I can‚Äôt undo the past, but hopefully by sharing my story, I can make a difference for someone else. She asked me not to blame anyone, so I honor that request and will only live with love in my heart. This is how I will honor her memory.

My hope is that through education and awareness, those suffering with a mental illness will be prompted to seek help. Most Americans remain unaware that suicide is a national health problem. The impact suicide has on the lives of family members, friends, co-workers and the community is devastating. It is also my hope to ensure that parents and teens are educated on symptoms of someone contemplating suicide and know how to handle if they or someone they love suffers from depression. By sharing my story, maybe just one young person will reach out to their parents or a friend and know they are not alone and it is okay to ask for help.

Mike was California's finest firefighter, tough, smart and dedicated. Respected amateur seismologist, he was working with a naval historian interested in my father's WWII service when he took his life. He also worked with Project Purr after his retirement, capturing feral cats and getting them neutered and spayed. He and his wife Caroline fed all the feral cats in their neighborhood, taking some into their home. Mike struggled with alcoholism and undiagnosed major depression (diagnosed as simple dysthymia instead) for many years. An unsuccessful detox attempt and the death of his dog in the same week were the triggers of his suicide at age 59 in October 2009. He had attempted suicide a year earlier. I felt constant, intense grief and guilt for three years after his death. Finally, during the fourth year, I found that I was going a whole day without crying, and eventually a day without thoughts of the suicide. It's now been five years and I haven't reached a point where I have joy back in my life, but the difference between how I feel now and how I felt the first few years is very definite - Mike's suicide isn't the main focus of my life anymore, and when I think of it I feel sadness now instead of crippling grief. I let myself grieve without any restrictions, and it allowed me to get to this point. I still think of him almost daily, but the sadness has a bottom limit now. Just the other day, while camping, my husband and I talked about Mike. My husband said Mike's death felt to him like a huge waste, and talked about how much he had liked him. I miss him all the time."

While he did not seem to struggle with his identity as a young gay man, he undoubtedly faced discrimination from many.

Jeff was a wonderful son, a great brother, a sweet grandson, a loving uncle,and a loyal friend. He is missed by so many people whose lives he had touched."

Nick was a great man who suffered from bi-polar.  He would give the shirt off his back to help someone.  He loved to make people laugh and was always pulling small pranks. He loved music of all kinds.  He never wanted people to worry and would hide when he was in pain.  He was always worried about what people would think if they found out he had a mental illness...so he let people think he had a severe drug issue.  Eventually, he lost his battle with his mental illness and took his own life on June 18, 2014.

I miss his advice.  I miss his hugs.  I miss the joy.  I miss the peace.  I miss the love.  I miss the understanding.  His family and friends love him deeply."

Stefan was charming and easy to interact with. Years later and after reading the 11 pages letter he left behind, we realize he was in fnancial touble and saw no way out (athough we know there was). It took many years for each of us to learn to go on in a meaningful way without him. It's been 15 years now and I still go through feelings of anger and great love. There's an internal scar that not everyone can see. It is tme that allows us to regain control of our own lives and make them meaningful. Suicide changes the way survivors spend our time, with whom we associate, and what we value. Life is short. Surround yourself wiith all that celebrates you.

I don't remember every friend's birthday party but for whatever reason I distinctly remember pieces of Malaya's 13th. It's very possible that these were pieced together after she died because, as so many know, any tiny memory becomes infinitely more important after someone dies, especially by suicide. Like many 13 year olds in the early 2000s, we watched Bend It Like Beckham. Malaya's mom walked in just as the one curse word in the entire film was said. We all giggled as Malaya explained to her mother that poor timing of her entrance.
